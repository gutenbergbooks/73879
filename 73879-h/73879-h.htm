<hr class="decor spaced2 width4">

<p class="space-above2">This book is an attempt to give a
systematic account of the geography and geology of South-Eastern
Egypt according to the latest information available. It is based on
surveys which I carried out by order of the Egyptian Government
during the four years 1905-1908, and has been written in the
intervals of other official work during the succeeding three
years.</p>

<p>In the first or introductory chapter, I have given a summary,
with some criticisms, of previous accounts of the region. This
seemed advisable in that the literature, although not very
extensive, is scattered in books and papers in various languages,
and is not always easy of access.</p>

<p>The second chapter is a concise systematic account of the
district, designed mainly as a summary for those who do not wish to
go into the details; it also contains sections dealing with matters
of insufficient importance, or of which our knowledge is too
scanty, to be treated of specially in the succeeding chapters.</p>

<p>The third chapter is an account of the surveying methods
employed and the principal geographical results obtained. The
surveying methods are treated at some length, firstly because an
adequate specification of the survey methods used is necessary for
the assessment of the value of any contribution to modern
geography, and, secondly, because some of the methods are either
new or little known, and have been found by experience to be
specially adapted to the mapping of this type of country. The
principal geographical results are given, mostly in tabular form,
as exhibiting clearly the groundwork of the actual maps, and as
indicating a series of adequately fixed positions which may be
employed as a basis in any further surveys.</p>

<p>In the fourth to sixth chapters the drainage lines and hill
features are systematically described. A knowledge of the
drainage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">[vi]</span> lines, as
the key to a precise understanding of the relief, is nowhere more
important than in these deserts.</p>

<p>In the seventh chapter the important question of water supplies
is considered, and the positions and particulars of the various
water sources are tabulated for easy reference.</p>

<p>The eighth to tenth chapters deal with the various rocks
occurring in the district. The petrology of the region has been
discussed with some fulness, because while the district offers a
remarkable wealth of rock-species, well exposed in considerable
masses, detailed studies of Egyptian petrology have hitherto been
few. My great regret in this connexion is that I have been unable
to add chemical analyses of the rocks.</p>

<p>The eleventh chapter summarises the general geological structure
and history of the region, as gathered from a broader outlook over
the detailed geological evidences.</p>

<p>In the twelfth chapter I have set down the information I was
able to obtain regarding the territorial limits of the different
Bedouin tribes inhabiting the region.</p>

<p>The thirteenth and concluding chapter of the book consists of
brief notes taken on the return march to Port Sudan.</p>

<p>In regard to the cartographic material, most of which is new,
special attention has been given to the place-names, and it is
believed that these are correct in almost every case. But as the
names are in languages not understood by European draughtsmen, it
is almost impossible that mistakes have been entirely avoided; in
any case where map and text may disagree in spelling (the
differences will, I trust, never be so great as to leave doubts of
identity), the text should be followed in preference to the map, as
mistakes in the text are usually more easily perceived and
corrected. I would remark that although the whole of the field maps
have been employed in preparing the small scale ones, yet the full
detail can be recorded only on the large scale maps, which are
given for the most important districts; a future explorer would do
well, therefore, to refer to the manuscript field maps which are
filed at the Survey Office at Gîza, before concluding that no more
detailed survey exists than is shown on the maps in this book.</p>

<p>The plates illustrating the scenic types are from my own
photographs, while those illustrating the natural-size aspect of
the typical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vii">[vii]</span> rocks
are reproductions from water-colour drawings which I made from
actual specimens. These coloured plates of rocks are mainly
designed to enable prospectors to identify readily the ordinary
kinds of stone they meet with in the field; but they will also
serve to give to petrologists an idea of the appearance of hand
specimens of rocks from this part of the world, which are not
frequently met with in the great museums. The text figures of rock
sections I have mostly drawn at the microscope on silver prints
from photographic plates, the prints being afterwards bleached out
with mercuric chloride; they will appear slightly diagrammatic in
places, owing to the necessity of using lines and dots for tints,
but I find I myself get a better idea of a rock from a drawing of
this kind than from a photograph.</p>

<p>Much detailed surveying of this mountainous and arid region
remains yet to be done, especially in the districts round the heads
of the Wadi Alaqi, before our knowledge of it can be considered
complete. It is hoped, however, that a substantial beginning has
been made towards this end, and that future work may be facilitated
by the observational data recorded in the following pages.</p>

</div>

<p class="space-above2">The district treated of in this volume
constitutes the extreme south-east corner of Egypt, lying between
the parallels of 22° and 25° of north latitude, and between the
meridian of 34° E. and the Red Sea coast. It comprises an area of
about 56,000 square kilometres, and includes some of the most
mountainous and least accessible portions of the Khedive’s
dominions.</p>

<p>The district has been comparatively little visited by
travellers, and the literature concerning it is not very extensive.
Berenice (<em>Jh</em>)<a id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1"
class="fnanchor">[1]</a> was founded by Ptolemy II (285-247
<span class="sc2">B.C.</span>), who named the town after his
mother, as a station at one end of the road for transporting goods
from the Red Sea to the Nile at Koptos (Quft). The emerald mines in
the Zabara area<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span> were
worked at least as early as Ptolemaic times, and gold mines in the
south at a much earlier date.</p>

<p>References to this part of Egypt occur in the writings of
<span class="sc">Strabo</span>, <span class="sc">Diodorus
Siculus</span>, and <span class="sc">Pliny</span>, as well as in
<span class="sc">Ptolemy</span>’s Geography and the <span class=
"sc">Antonine Itinerary</span>. Both Strabo and Pliny state that in
Berenice, as in Syene, the sun cast no shadow at the summer
solstice from which they inferred the town to be on the tropic of
Cancer, though in reality it lay in their day some twenty-five
kilometres, and is now about 28′, or some fifty-two kilometres,
north of the tropic, the difference being caused by the secular
change in the obliquity of the ecliptic since the beginning of the
Christian era. Ptolemy gives the latitude of Berenice as 23° 50′,
which is only 5′ too low; the <em>Smaragdus mons</em>, or emerald
mountain, he places in latitude 25°, which is about 15′ higher than
the true position of Gebel Zabara (<em>Ec</em>). Diodorus gives a
very clear description of the working of gold mines in the Eastern
Desert in his day, by miserable convict labour. The road from
Koptos to Berenice is mentioned, with lists of stations and water
reservoirs and their distances from each other, both by Pliny and
the writer of the Antonine Itinerary; and though Pliny gives fewer
stations than the Itinerary, the two accounts agree very closely in
estimating the total distance at about 258 Roman miles, which, so
far as can be judged from a partial identification of the stations
marking the route, is pretty correct. The island of Zeberged
(<em>Ok</em>), on which occurs the green gem called peridot, is
probably the <em>Topazos Insula</em> of Diodorus, and the
<em>Agathon</em> of Ptolemy; but Diodorus gives its length as
eighty stades (about twelve kilometres), which is three times
greater than its present size, and Ptolemy’s latitude of 23½° is
some 16′ too low. Ptolemy states that the coast was inhabited by
the <em>Ichthyophages</em>, or fish-eaters, while the
<em>Troglodytes</em>, or cave-dwellers, of Strabo, were probably
the workers in the mines.</p>

<p>The books of the Arab geographers, <span class=
"sc">Edrisi</span> and <span class="sc">Abu el Feda</span>, contain
some references to the roads and mines of the Eastern Desert, but
their descriptions are unimportant and contain frequent palpable
errors.</p>

<p><span class="sc">D’Anville</span>, in his <em>Mémoires sur
l’Egypte</em>, Paris, 1766, pp. 230-235, attempted to construct a
map of the coast of the Red Sea by combining the classical records
with some early Portuguese and other charts, but the latter were
too crude to enable any approach to be made to an accurate map.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>It has been thought
that <span class="sc">Bruce</span> discovered the island of
Zeberged and the emerald mines of Zabara in 1769, but it is
tolerably certain that he saw neither of these places. He estimated
the latitude of the island he saw “pretty exactly” as 25° 3′, and
its distance from the coast as three miles,<a id=
"FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
whereas Zeberged is really in latitude 23° 36′, and is over thirty
miles from the nearest coast. The mines he saw were so close to the
coast that he could walk to them from his boat and back in less
than a day (in fact he states that they were only three miles from
the coast), while both the Sikait and the Zabara mines are over a
day’s journey from the sea. Nor could the mines have been the
sulphur workings near El Ranga (<em>He</em>), unless Bruce made a
large error in his observation for latitude, for the sulphur mines
are about in latitude 24° 25′, and, moreover, Bruce states that he
found “brittle green crystals,” not sulphur.</p>

<p>It is to the French traveller <span class=
"sc">Cailliaud</span><a id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3"
class="fnanchor">[3]</a> that we owe the first modern account of
Berenice and the emerald mines. Cailliaud was a mineralogist, in
favour with Mohammad Ali Pasha, who sent him on two expeditions in
1816 and 1817 to search for mines in the Eastern Desert. On his
first expedition, starting from Redesia (near Edfu), he discovered
the rock temple of Seti I, forty-five kilometres east of the Nile,
and several ancient stations on his route, and proceeded to the
emerald mines of Zabara and the sulphur mines of El Ranga. On his
second expedition he took with him sixty Albanian workmen to
exploit the mines, and led them by nearly his former route to
Zabara, where they extracted ten lbs. weight of emeralds (beryls)
for presentation to the Pasha. On this second expedition Cailliaud
discovered the mines and ruins of Sikait, and also other ruins in
the Wadi Nugrus (<em>Ed</em>). Cailliaud’s drawings of the ruins of
Sikait greatly exaggerate their size and elegance.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Jomard</span>, in notes prefaced to Cailliaud’s
account of his travels, made a careful study of the probable
positions of the ancient roads and mines in this part of Egypt; he
thought that Wadi Gemal Island (<em>Hd</em>) was Zeberged.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>In 1818,
<span class="sc">Belzoni</span>,<a id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> fired by Cailliaud’s
discoveries, set out to discover the ancient Berenice. Starting
from Edfu, he travelled eastward for some days over Cailliaud’s
route, then marched <em>via</em> Bir Samut (where he discovered the
ancient station) and Wadi Ghuel to the Zabara mines, where he found
Cailliaud’s miners still at work. From Zabara he journeyed through
the Wadi Sikait, passing the mines and ruined temples which had
been discovered by Cailliaud, and down the Wadi Gemal to the sea.
Proceeding then southward along the coast, he examined the sulphur
mines at El Ranga near the mouth of the Wadi Abu Ghusun, and then
made his discovery of the ruins of the temple and town of Berenice,
near the peninsula of “Cape Galahen” (Ras Benas). The ruins were so
inconspicuous as to be only found with difficulty, and the temple
was so buried in sand that Belzoni could only make a very imperfect
plan of it. The ancient town he estimates to have covered a space
near the temple 1,600 feet broad and 2,000 feet long. Leaving
Berenice the same day on which he made his discovery, Belzoni
returned to Sikait by way of Abu Greia, Haratreit (where he
discovered ancient stations), Hefeiri well, and the spring of Um
Sueh. After copying some Greek inscriptions at Sikait, he returned
to Edfu by way of Wadis Hafafit (<em>Dc</em>), where he found an
ancient station, Abu Had, and Samut.</p>

<p>Belzoni’s map<a id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class=
"fnanchor">[5]</a> of his routes is of course very crude and
erroneous, but the fact that he gives the names of the places he
passed enables one to reconstruct his routes on modern maps with
fair exactitude. His drawings of the ruins he visited are fairly
accurate, that of the rock temple of Sikait being a much truer
picture than Cailliaud’s.</p>

<p>The extreme south-east corner of Egypt was first explored in
1831 and 1832 by <span class="sc">Linant de Bellefonds</span>, who
twenty years later published an interesting account of his travels
and discoveries.<a id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class=
"fnanchor">[6]</a> The manner in which Linant Bey’s expedition
arose is very curious. He had read the accounts of Diodorus and
Arabic writers concerning the ancient gold mines of the Eastern
Desert, and when he accidentally<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_5">[5]</span> discovered small crystals of gold in quartzose
detritus brought down the Wadi Alaqi into the Nile by a storm
torrent, he at once inferred that this wadi would lead him to the
mines. The Arabs told him, quite correctly, that the down-wash had
its origin far up the wadi, nine days’ journey from its mouth.
Reporting his discovery to Mohammad Ali Pasha, that prince
commissioned him to lead an expedition to search for the mines.
Starting from Aswan, Linant journeyed south-east and discovered the
ancient mines and ruins at Gebel Seiga (<em>Bp</em>), and
subsequently the more extensive workings at various places round
the head of Wadi Alaqi, such as Egat (<em>Ft</em>) and Darahib
(<em>Gu</em>). From the Alaqi district he proceeded northward to
Bir Shinai (<em>Hr</em>), and thence eastwards round the spurs of
the mountains to Bir Meisah (<em>Kr</em>), east of which he
discovered the old mines of Romit (<em>Ls</em>). Crossing the great
Wadi Di-ib, he appears to have reached Bir Akwamtra (<em>Os</em>),
at the foot of Gebel Elba. His desire to explore the mysterious
Elba mountains was frustrated by the Arabs, and he only ascended a
minor peak before commencing his return march. From Elba he
returned <em>via</em> Bir Meisah, Bir Beida (<em>Ho</em>), and the
Wadis Khashab (<em>Gn</em>), Hodein, Rod el Kharuf (<em>Ch</em>),
and Kharit to Daraw on the Nile, discovering the springs of Abu
Saafa (<em>Em</em>) in the course of his march.</p>

<p>Linant thus performed for the south portion of the district a
similar service to that which his compatriot Cailliaud had already
done for the north portion. His remarks on the people of the
country, their manners and customs, are no less interesting than
his descriptions of the ruins and mines which he discovered. The
notes on certain points, such as the manner of trapping the wild
ass which then roamed these deserts, are specially interesting as
illustrating past usages. Linant also compiled a small
Bisharin-French vocabulary as an appendix to his work. The large
map accompanying his book, though it is well engraved and depicts
well the general mountainous character of the country, is
unfortunately full of large errors; Gebel Is (<em>Jt</em>), for
example, is placed more than sixty kilometres too far south; while
many of the place-names are either wholly incorrect or so loosely
transliterated as to be almost unrecognisable. But with all its
defects, Linant’s map remained the only source for cartographers
for a large portion of the Eastern Desert down to the time of the
commencement of the present survey; the map of Egypt published in
1905 by the Topographical Section of the British
General<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span> Staff, for
instance, contains much of Linant’s material, though a comparison
of that map with the one joined to this report will show how great
were the errors in the matter thus incorporated.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Wilkinson</span><a id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> gives very brief notes on
Berenice and the ancient roads leading to it, as well as on the
emerald mines of Zabara and the ruins of the Sikait district.
Wilkinson believed he had identified all the ancient stations on
the Koptos-Berenice road, besides another smaller one not mentioned
in classical itineraries. In the temple of Berenice he found a
small fountain, which is now in the British Museum. But his work
added little to what had already been learned by Cailliaud and
Belzoni regarding this part of Egypt.</p>

<p>In 1836, <span class="sc">Wellsted</span>,<a id=
"FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> a
lieutenant in the Indian Navy, who had been employed in surveying
the Red Sea coast, described the topography of Berenice, and
assigned to the place its true latitude of 23° 55′. He gives a plan
and view of the temple, which he partially cleared, and in which he
found fragments of Greek tablets and of a statue.</p>

<p>Between 1830 and 1840 important contributions were furnished to
the geography of Eastern Egypt by the surveys of the Red Sea,
carried out by <span class="sc">Moresby</span>, <span class=
"sc">Wellsted</span>, and other officers of the East India
Company’s Navy. Their sailing directions formed the foundation of
the “Red Sea and Gulf of Aden Pilot,” now published by the British
Admiralty.<a id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class=
"fnanchor">[9]</a> Both the charts and sailing directions have been
continually revised by Admiralty surveys, and furnish much accurate
information about the coast. The principal errors are that almost
the entire coast-line between latitudes 22° and 25° is placed too
far to the west,<a id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10"
class="fnanchor">[10]</a> and some of the place-names are wrong, or
at least unknown to the local sailors of to-day. Such details of
the inland relief as are given on the charts are not correct, as
was of course to be expected in a hydrographic survey; but the main
summits are fairly accurately laid down, and their altitudes agree
well with my determinations. Thus the “Southern peak” of the chart,
in latitude<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span> 23° 18′, is
Gebel Fereyid;<a id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class=
"fnanchor">[11]</a> the “Black conical hill,” near Mersa Shab, is
Gemeida; “Scragged hill” is Qash Amir;<a id=
"FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
“High peak” is Gebel Elba; “Castle hill” is Gebel Shendodai; and
“South peak” is Asotriba, the highest mountain of the Elba
group.</p>

<p>In 1846, <span class="sc">Barth</span> made a journey from Aswân
to Berenice and thence to Qoseir, and subsequently published a
brief journal of his expedition.<a id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> Going eastward from Aswân,
he passed north of Gebel Hamrat Mukbud (<em>Cf</em>), <em>via</em>
the Wadi Khashab, past the tomb of Sheikh Shadli (<em>Df</em>) and
the granite boss of Selaia (<em>Fh</em>), which he thought to be of
slate, and then descended to the coast by Wadi Salib Abiad and Wadi
Khoda (<em>Hf</em>). He discovered the old station (now called
Garia Kalalat) south-west of Berenice, on his way to the temple, of
which he took measures. Barth remarks on the insignificant nature
of the ruins and on the badness of the site for a town. On his
return journey, he discovered the wells and ruins of Shenshef
(<em>Jj</em>), where there are well preserved remains of
substantial dwellings which he thought denoted a settlement by
people from Berenice. Ascending the Wadi Shut after returning to
Wadi Khoda, he turned westward and reached the plain south of the
Abu Hamamid-Hamata mountains. Crossing this mountain track by the
difficult pass of Hilgit, he descended the Wadi Huluz
(<em>Ef</em>), into Wadi Gemal, whence he turned northward and
visited the ruins of Sikait. From Sikait he proceeded by winding
tracks past Bir Ghadir (<em>Ec</em>) and on to Qoseir.</p>

<p>The next traveller to visit the district, <span class="sc">von
Heuglin</span>, examined the country from the coast.<a id=
"FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
Sailing southward from Qoseir, he discovered ruins which he thought
to be those of Ptolemy’s <em>Nechesia</em>, in latitude 24° 55′, a
little south of Ras Tundeba. Further south, he enumerates the
various openings and anchorages of the coast to Suakin. Gebel
Hamata (<em>Gf</em>) he wrongly thought might be the Alaqi of the
ancient mining records. His “Wadi el Hemmah” is doubtless Wadi
Lahami (<em>Hg</em>). Rounding Ras Benas, he passed the coral
island of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span> Mukawar
(Geziret el Ras), and anchored by the ruins of Berenice, which he
states to be called Sikait Qibli.<a id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> In and near the temple
ruins von Heuglin found copper nails, fragments of statues, Roman
coins, a quartz sistrum and pieces of beryl, besides potsherds and
broken glass. Passing Mersa Shab (Sherm Hel el Madfa), he notes a
few fishermen’s dwellings on Seyal Island, and a pearl fisher from
Jidda plying his calling at a small anchorage called Gota, near Ras
Fatma. He mentions Kwolala as “Geziret Elba,” close to the
“peninsula of Halaib” (now an island, Geziret Halaib).<a id=
"FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
The Elba mountains he states to be the <em>Prionotus mons</em> of
Ptolemy. The “Sherm Qubeten,” which he notes to the south of
Halaib, is doubtless Mersa Qabatit of my map.</p>

<p>It is to the veteran African traveller <span class=
"sc">Schweinfurth</span> that we owe the first investigations of
the Elba mountains, as long surrounded with mystery as the
stronghold of dreaded Bisharin tribes.<a id=
"FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
Like von Heuglin, Schweinfurth visited the country from the coast,
making excursions inland. Starting from Qoseir in March, 1864, he
proceeded with frequent stoppages to Suakin, spending nearly six
months in exploring the littoral districts. His chief object was
the investigation of the flora of the country, but his
accounts<a id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class=
"fnanchor">[18]</a> contain much geographical and geological
information of great interest. He compares the coastal ranges of
Africa with the Cordilleras of South America, and the Abyssinian
highlands with Quito. The flora of the Elba district he found to be
sharply marked off from that of the rest of Egypt by the presence
of large numbers of plants of Abyssinian types. Among his
geological notes, it is interesting to come across a reference to
serpentine, which I have lately found to form the great mountain
masses of Abu Dahr (<em>Gk</em>), Korabkansi (<em>Fq</em>), and
Gerf (<em>Hp</em>). Schweinfurth wrote, however, in the early days
of petrography, and his term<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_9">[9]</span> “basalts” includes a variety of fine-grained
dark eruptive rocks which we should now call by other names. The
sulphur mines of El Ranga he characterised as worthless, the
mineral being in very small quantity. Schweinfurth’s map of the
Elba district was a great advance on anything of the kind
previously existing, though it contains many inaccuracies,
particularly of place-names, as was in fact only to be expected
from his very short stay in the locality. He remarked the
separation of Gebel Elba (<em>Pr</em>) from the more southern
mountains, but failed to notice that Qash Amir (<em>Os</em>), (the
“Scragged Hill” of the Admiralty Chart), is in its turn quite
distinct from Elba, Halaib is called Elei,<a id=
"FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
and the Geziret Halaib is shown as a peninsula; Kwolala is called
“Geziret Elei,” and the Geziret el Dibia (the Elba Island of the
charts) is called Geziret Abu Fendira by Schweinfurth. My Wadi
Shellal he calls “Wadi Heberah,” and Cape Elba (my Ras Hadarba) is
noted as “Ras Edineb.” His “highest peak” (South Peak of the
charts) is Asotriba, the highest mountain of the group, lying just
within the Sudan; the name Asotriba (Schweinfurth’s “Soturba”)
means “green mountain,” and refers to the vegetation on its slopes.
Schweinfurth’s experience of the Bisharin led him to give them a
very bad character, though he gives high recognition to their
beauty of feature and figure; but being unfamiliar with their
language was, he admits, an obstacle to forming a fair judgment of
them.</p>

<p>In 1873, Colonels <span class="sc">Purdy</span> and <span class=
"sc">Colston</span>, two American officers attached to the Egyptian
Army, were commissioned by the Khedive Ismail Pasha to carry out a
reconnaissance for a proposed railway line between Berenice and
Berber. Colston<a id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20"
class="fnanchor">[20]</a> travelled overland from Qena <em>via</em>
Qoseir to Berenice, discovering several ancient stations on his way
to join Purdy. Though Purdy sanguinely states<a id=
"FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
that “la construction d’un chemin de fer de ce point (Berenice) à
Berber n’offrirait pas de grandes difficultés,” the reconnaissance
appears to have been singularly rough for a decision in so weighty
a matter. Distances were mere guesses, and the only instruments
employed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span> seem to have
been a compass, aneroid, and hypsometer. The compass must often
have been unreliable owing to magnetic rocks, which in places
deflect the needle as much as 40° from its normal position, while
the use of the aneroid was so little understood that Purdy could
actually write, in the concluding paragraph of his paper: “Je me
permets de rappeler l’attention sur les notes barométriques jointes
à ce rapport. A ce propos, je dois faire observer que quoique
l’anéroïde soit très sensible aux changements de niveau, il ne
l’est pas assez pour la pression atmosphérique, et sa marche est
excessivement irrégulière. . . . Il m’est arrivé, par exemple, de
constater, le matin, au moment du départ, une différence sensible
du point marqué le soir précédent à mon arrivée.” Not only are many
of the place-names given by Purdy erroneous, but some of his most
important statements are contrary to fact; to take only a few
examples, the Wadi Kalalat is confused with Wadi Shenshef, and
Gebel Shut with Gebel Dahanib, while it is stated that no water
exists between Gebel Dif (<em>Fm</em>) and Gebel Egat
(<em>Ft</em>), although there are several good wells between the
two places. The map accompanying Purdy’s paper is full of errors,
and almost worse than useless. Of Colston’s route from Qena to
Berenice there was no published cartographic record until 1891,
when G. <span class="sc">Cora</span><a id=
"FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
endeavoured to place Colston’s track on a map from his manuscript
sketches. Cora’s map shows no new material except the route, and
even this cannot be very correct, for it is evident on comparison
with the results of the recent survey that Colston’s sketch map was
of the same rough and inaccurate character as Purdy’s.</p>

<p>In January 1889, <span class="sc">Golénischeff</span> made an
expedition from the Nile to Berenice and back. His object was to
collect archæological information, especially concerning the
ancient roads and stations, but the careful account<a id=
"FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
which he has given of his journey is also of geographical interest.
Starting from Redesia by Cailliaud’s route, he examined the temple
of Seti I, and then discovered the ancient station of Abu
Medrik<a id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class=
"fnanchor">[24]</a> further to the south-east. Passing the
ruins<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span> at Samut and
Dweig (<em>Cc</em>), he found another small station on the way to
Abu Had, and arrived at the station in Wadi Gemal (<em>Ed</em>),
near Wadi Hafafit. From the Wadi Gemal he proceeded <em>via</em>
the Wadis Abiad (<em>Fe</em>), Abu Hegilig, Hefeiri, Abu Ghusun
(<em>Ge</em>), Haratreit (<em>Hf</em>), Khashir (in which another
ancient station was discovered), and Lahami (<em>Hg</em>), past the
Abu Greia ruins, to Berenice. He returned by way of Wadis Naait
(<em>Hh</em>) and Lahami on to the plain of Kharit, and thence past
Hamrat Mukbud (<em>Cf</em>), <em>via</em> the Wadis Khashab, Kharit
(<em>Ag</em>), and Abu Modellim, to the Nile. Golénischeff, besides
giving small plans of the various ancient stations and a carefully
measured plan of the temple of Berenice, made a comparison of his
itinerary with the descriptions of the old roads by classical
writers and by Colston. He considers there can be no doubt that Abu
Greia is the <em>Vetus hydreuma</em> of Pliny, and the ruins in
Wadi Khashir the <em>Novum hydreuma</em> of the same writer. The
ruins in Wadi Haratreit he considers to be the station
<em>Cabalsi</em> of the Antonine Itinerary, <em>Apollonus</em>
being identified with the well found by Colston at Hefeiri,
<em>Falacro</em> with the ruins in the Wadi Gemal, and
<em>Aristonis</em> with those in Wadi Dweig.</p>

<p>In 1891, <span class="sc">Floyer</span>, at the head of a
scientific exploring expedition sent out by the Khedive Tewfik
Pasha, travelled over the country north of 23° 30′, and his results
were published in French in 1893.<a id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> A little later, the
geographical results of the expedition were embodied in an English
paper read at the Royal Geographical Society.<a id=
"FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>
The general map in the French essay is only on a very small scale,
but the English publication is accompanied by a much more
illuminating map on a scale of 1:760,320, reduced from one prepared
by the Intelligence Division of the War Office from Floyer’s
original plane-table sketches. This latter map, in spite of many
errors and defects, was a very great advance on anything which had
previously appeared, and it formed the principal source of
geographical information concerning the north part of the district
at the commencement of my survey in 1905.</p>

<p>The geological observations made by Floyer during his expedition
formed the subject of a paper read by him before the Geological
Society of London in 1892.<a id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> This paper is chiefly
remarkable for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span> the
number of grave errors of observation into which Floyer’s limited
acquaintance with geology caused him to fall, and later researches
have fully justified the scepticism with which his deductions were
received by the Society. Thus, for instance, he refers to the
ancient schists and slates of Zabara as “blue clay,”<a id=
"FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
and to the dark schists and diorite of Abu Hamamid and Abu Gurdi as
“compact granite.” The rocks which Floyer considered to be
“metamorphosed sandstone” are diorites and schists at Um Eleiga and
in the Wadi Gemal, and typical gneisses and granites in the Nugrus
and Hafafit ranges. Not a trace of sandstone has been found to
exist within many miles of the places where Floyer records its
metamorphism, nor has any evidence of the recent volcanic activity
reported by him (<em>Geog. Journal</em>, 1893, p. 430) been
discovered.</p>

<p>An account of a short visit to the Elba district was published
by <span class="sc">Bent</span><a id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> in 1896. Bent landed at
Halaib and camped near Gebel Shellal (<em>Qt</em>). He thinks that
Halaib may have been the town of <em>Aydat</em> mentioned by the
Arab geographers Abu el Feda and Edrisi, and that it is a place of
purely Arab origin. At Suakin el Qadim (<em>Qs</em>) he found among
the mounds nothing earlier than Cufic remains, unless certain
graves, formed of four large blocks of coral set deep in the
ground, may be looked upon as a more ancient form of sepulture. His
“Gebel Shendeh” should be correctly Gebel Shendib, and his
“Shendoeh” is correctly Shendodai; the “Riadh” mentioned by him I
have not been able to identify. His estimated heights are
considerably in error; thus Gebel Shendib is really 6,273 feet and
Gebel Shellal 4,623 feet instead of the 4,500 feet and 4,100 feet
which he gives. The paper contains interesting remarks on the
Hamedorab tribe, which Bent was informed totalled only some 300
fighting men in the entire district from Asotriba to Ras Benas. The
reference to the sheikh as “the batran” is due to a misconception;
Batran was the late sheikh’s first name, and is not a title of
station. The map accompanying Bent’s paper is only to a very small
scale, and formed practically no addition to existing
knowledge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span><span class=
"sc">Macalister</span><a id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> has given a detailed and
interesting account of the Sikait district (<em>Ed</em>), with
special reference to its geology, as the result of an expedition
there in 1899. The small scale sketch map of the route followed in
reaching the mines from the valley is not very correct, but the
detail maps of the Sikait neighbourhood give an accurate
representation of the area in which the mines are situated, while
the geological notes give an excellent idea of one of the most
highly metamorphic areas of the entire Eastern Desert. Macalister
gives some notes also on the ruins and the people of the
neighbourhood. His experience of the Ababda as workers was very
unfavourable; though his characterisation is unfortunately only too
well merited by a large section of the tribe, it is probable that a
longer acquaintance with Arabs would have enabled him to select men
of a better class. A sufficiency of good men for a caravan of 130
camels cannot be raised without great expenditure of time and care,
even by those who have lived for many years among the Arabs, and a
few bad characters in a desert camp soon exert a bad influence over
the rest.</p>

<p>The brilliant series of investigations carried out by the
officers accompanying the Austrian research ship “<span class=
"sc">Pola</span>” in the Red Sea in the winter of 1895-96, though
chiefly concerned with oceanographic questions, contain not a few
observations of interest connected with the land.<a id=
"FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
The positions determined include Sherm Sheikh, Berenice, St. John’s
or Zeberged Island, and Halaib. The latitudes observed agree well
with the values which I found by triangulation.<a id=
"FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
For longitude the method used was the transport of chronometers,
and this method is liable to such considerable errors that we need
have no hesitation in preferring my triangulation values,
especially as our latitudes are in agreement. The observations made
by the officers of the “Pola” on the compass-variation at Berenice
and Halaib are of considerable importance as enabling us, by
comparison with my own observations at the same places, eleven and
twelve years later, to obtain a reliable value for the rate of
secular change of this magnetic element in the district. A large
scale map of Halaib is given, and<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_14">[14]</span> amongst other observations of interest to the
geographer in South-Eastern Egypt are analyses of the water at
Halaib, a series of pendulum observations which show a decided
increase in the force of gravity over the sea as compared with the
intensity over the land, and descriptions with figures of some of
the reptiles which are found in the region.</p>

<p>Turning now to the work of the <span class="sc">Geological
Survey</span> in the district, the maps and descriptions in the
present volume are the result of surveys carried out by me in the
three seasons 1905-1908, or about twenty-two months’ work in all.
The survey was commenced primarily with the view of enabling mining
concessions to be accurately marked out. How little possibility of
this existed so recently as 1902 may be gathered from the fact that
although a ministerial order of that year had defined the
administrative frontier between Egypt and the Sudan as being a line
joining certain important mountains and wells, which were named,
yet it was impossible to lay this frontier down correctly on a map
because the geographical positions even of these important features
were uncertain to many kilometres.</p>

<p>The main interest in the field methods used, which will be
described in detail in a subsequent chapter, lies in the fact that
many of them are wholly or in part new, having been devised as the
work proceeded to meet the special exigencies of the case. The
costly nature of camel-transport, and the relatively small value of
the country, precluded the employment of the ordinary sequence of
survey operations, and it was necessary to carry on reconnaissance,
precise triangulation, detailed topographical mapping, and
geological surveying, all at once, and to move rapidly so as to
cover a large area in a moderate time. Starting from a measured
base near Gebel Muelih, which had been previously connected by
triangulation with the Nile Valley, a network of large triangles
was thrown over the country. The essential feature of the
triangulation was the employment of observations at relatively few
occupied main summits, to fix large numbers of points by
intersection; in some cases over a hundred triangulation points
were sighted from a single occupied station. The triangulation was
continued so as to join to a second base line near Gebel Um Harba
(<em>Ck</em>), and was also connected on to main points in the
trigonometrical survey of the Sudan, thus linking up a continuous
chain of triangles from Alexandria to Berber. The total number of
main<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span> (occupied)
stations was sixty-four, while the intersected points numbered 450.
In addition to these, about 1,200 minor points were fixed by
subsidiary triangulation from short local bases.</p>

<p>Levels were taken trigonometrically for all points fixed by
triangulation, using the actual sea-level as the datum. The
altitudes of nearly all camps were likewise found
trigonometrically, and between successive camps aneroid readings,
adjusted to the initial and terminal points of the day’s march,
were employed to supplement trigonometrical determinations made on
the journey.</p>

<p>For the control of the maps, latitudes and azimuths were taken
at intervals, the former by equal altitudes of three or more stars,
the latter by elongations of close circumpolar stars.</p>

<p>The topographical sketching, carried out on plane-tables on a
scale of 1:100,000, was based on the points triangulated, these
being computed in camp and plotted by their geographical
coordinates as much ahead of the lines of march as possible. When
marching, plane-table stations were fixed by re-section from three
or more triangulated points, the compass being useless owing to
abundance of magnetic rocks. Details along the line of march were
put in by tacheometric readings from the stations, using specially
devised long distance methods. But the greater portion of the
sketching was done from the mountain tops while occupying them as
trigonometrical stations, and for this again special methods,
involving an extensive use of vertical angles, were employed. On an
average, about thirty square kilometres were sketched in during
each day’s march, and about 400 square kilometres from each main
trigonometrical station, where it was usually necessary to remain
for at least a week to get sufficiently clear weather for the more
distant sights. It was not, of course, possible to sketch every
portion of the area in uniform detail, for some parts lay so far
from the line of march and from the triangulation stations that
little or no detail was visible. The lacunæ were filled in as far
as possible in the field from guides’ statements, taking care on
the field maps to distinguish parts so filled as only approximate.
A few additions near the west limit of the map have been added from
reconnaissance surveys by various colleagues of the Survey
Department. For details of the upper part of the basin of the Wadi
Alaqi, I have taken advantage of an admirable reconnaissance-survey
of this tract recently made by Mr. J. <span class="sc">Morrow
Campbell</span>, <span class="sc">B.Sc.</span>,
F.R.G.S.,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span> for the
Egyptian Options, Ltd., who kindly placed their map at the disposal
of the Government. My triangulation gave the positions and
altitudes of all the principal peaks of this region, and thus
enabled Mr. Campbell’s map to be accurately adjusted to the Survey
positions, and his drainage lines and other topographical details
have been inserted with great advantage to the map, which would
otherwise have been almost blank in this particular area. Mr.
Campbell’s map does not, unfortunately, give any altitudes, and the
only altitude data for the orographical sketching were the peaks
and other points of connexion with the Survey map; but by taking
into account the depth of shading of the different hill masses and
the known altitudes determined by triangulation, it is believed
that a fairly approximate picture of the orography has been
obtained.</p>

<p>The sea coast north of latitude 24° 10′ was adapted from the
Admiralty Chart, fitting it on to coast points trigonometrically
fixed. South of 24° 10′ the coast was surveyed in detail by means
of depression angles from the occupied peaks of the triangulation.
The local circumstances, in the existence of high mountains pretty
close to the sea, are so favourable to the employment of this
method, that it is confidently believed that the maps represent a
considerable advance in accuracy over the Admiralty Charts. It was
frequently possible to check the accuracy of the coast-line
delineation by plane-table rays, and it was invariably found that
the errors were insensible, even on the fairly large scale employed
in the field-maps. The coast-line shown is the high water-line. The
tidal change of level, though it is generally less than a metre,
uncovers in many places extensive coral reefs at low water, but no
attempt was made to map these.</p>

<p>Very special care was taken with place-names, which are
transliterated on the Egyptian Government system. It may be
remarked that this system is based on the Arabic <em>spelling</em>,
not on pronunciation. Thus, in this part of the country, the letter
<em>g</em> is almost always soft, like an English <em>j</em>, and
the <em>q</em> is always sounded like a hard <em>g</em>. The same
system was used for the Bishari and Ababda names, these being first
written by a guide in Arabic characters and then transliterated. It
is believed that the orthography is correct in almost all
cases.</p>

<p>The geology was examined along every line of march, and
additional specimens were obtained by sending guides to collect
rocks from mountains otherwise unvisited. Where possible, the
principal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span> geological
boundaries were drawn direct on the plane-table sheets in the
field, and the remainder have been placed from field notes. The
limits of the different igneous and metamorphic rocks shown on the
geological map aim only at showing general relationships, for in
many cases it is difficult, owing to insensible gradations, to
decide exactly where granites and diorites end and gneisses and
schists begin, while in other places rocks of two or three distinct
species are so intimately mixed that the boundaries could not be
shown on the small scale used, even if the exact limits were traced
by a life-time’s work; in these latter cases the areas are coloured
in accordance with what appeared to be the dominant rock within
them.</p>

<p>Throughout the three seasons’ work I was accompanied by Dahab
Effendi Hassan, who rendered useful assistance in booking angles
and in reconnaissance, and in the third season Mr. O. N. Bakewell
also accompanied me and gave me much useful help. The Egyptian
unskilled staff employed consisted almost entirely of Bedouin and
comprised on an average about twenty-five camel drivers (for
thiry-five baggage camels), six porters, three guides, and two
postmen, all placed under an Arab sheikh.</p>

<p>The total cost of the field-work was approximately L.E. 5,090,
or about 150 milliemes for each square kilometre of country mapped
in detail. Nearly two-thirds of the entire amount were expended in
camel-transport, the remainder representing the expenditure on
salaries and allowances of the author and assistants engaged in
actual surveying operations.</p>

<p>The subjects of topography, water supplies, and geology, will be
further considered more fully in succeeding chapters.</p>

<h3><a id="c02s01"></a>Extent.</h3>

<p>As already mentioned in the introduction, the district treated
of in this volume lies between the parallels of 25° and 22° of
north latitude, and between the meridian of 34° E. and the Red Sea.
It comprises an area of about 56,000 square kilometres (22,000
square miles).</p>

<h3><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span><a id=
"c02s02"></a>Relief.<a id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33"
class="fnanchor">[33]</a></h3>

<p>The higher mountains of the Eastern Desert generally form the
watershed between the Nile and the Red Sea. This watershed is much
nearer to the coast than to the Nile, with the result that the
eastward drainage is much steeper than to the west.</p>

<p>Commencing from the north (<em>see</em> the orographical map,
<a href="#pl01">Plate I</a>), the principal mountain masses
are:—</p>

<p>(i) The Migif — Hafafit — Nugrus — Hangalia — Zabara group
(1,505 metres<a id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class=
"fnanchor">[34]</a>), cut off to the south by the Wadi Gemal
(<em>Fd</em>).</p>

<p>(ii) The Abu Hamamid — Hamata — Abu Gurdi group (1,978 metres),
limited on the south by the Wadi Lahami (<em>Hg</em>).</p>

<p>(iii) The Um Gunud — Dahanib — Batoga group (1,270 metres),
lying between Wadi Lahami on the north and Wadi Khoda (<em>Hj</em>)
on the south.</p>

<p>(iv) The Abu Dahr — Orga — Um Tenedba group (1,131 metres),
separating the drainage of Wadi Betan (<em>Fl</em>) from Wadis
Khoda and Rahaba (<em>Hl</em>).</p>

<p>(v) The Faraid group, the <em>Mons Pentadactylus</em> of
Ptolemy, comprising some very remarkable granite peaks (1,366
metres), lying near the coast between Wadi Khoda and Wadi
Rahaba.</p>

<p>(vi) The Awamtib — Abraq — Dif — Aqab el Negum — Mishbih group
(1,353 metres), forming the tripartite watershed between the great
Wadi systems of Kharit and Alaqi on the west, and that of Wadi
Hodein on the east.</p>

<p>(vii) The Gerf — Abu Hodeid group, a mighty mass rising to 1,736
metres, lying between Wadi Hodein (<em>Jn</em>) and Wadi Hasium
(<em>Hs</em>).</p>

<p>(viii) The Meisah — Adar Qaqa — Is group, between the Wadis
Hasium and Di-ib (<em>Mr</em>).</p>

<p>(ix) The Elba — Shendib group (1,912 metres<a id=
"FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class=
"fnanchor">[35]</a>), a great mass of spiky mountains lying near
the sea between Wadi Di-ib and the coast.</p>

<p>Besides these main groups, there are numerous more or less
isolated mountains, of which Gebels Abu Khrug (<em>Bd</em>, 870
metres), Hamrat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
Mukbud (<em>Cf</em>, 890 metres), Zergat Naam (<em>Ej</em>, 845
metres), and the two Niqrubs (<em>Fn</em> and <em>Fo</em>, 829
metres and 1,078 metres) are examples.</p>

<p>Some of the mountains, especially the granite “bodkin” of Gebel
Faraid (<em>Hl</em>), and some of the peaks of the Elba group,
appear to be unclimbable. A few others are rather dangerous of
ascent, as, for example, Gebel Abu Hamamid (<em>Ef</em>) on account
of its steepness, and Gebel Abu Dahr (<em>Gk</em>) by reason of
combined steepness and rotten rock, which comes away in tons at a
touch. The highest peak of all within the district, Gebel Hamata
(<em>Gf</em>), is a comparatively easy climb from the north.</p>

<h3><a id="c02s03"></a>Hydrography.</h3>

<p>The course of the main watershed which parts the Red Sea and
Nile drainages is highly irregular both in altitude and direction,
as will be evident from the orographical map (<a href="#pl01">Plate
I</a>), on which it is shown by a red line. From Gebel Hamrat
Wogud, in the north, it passes east of Gebel Atut, thence through
the high masses of Gebels Hangalia, Nugrus, Hafafit, and Migif,
beyond which it drops southward through the low country round Gebel
Abu Had. Entering the mountains again at Gebel Nukheira, it takes
an eastward bend, passing along the great ridges of Gebels Abu
Hamamid, Um Usher, Um Hasidok, and Ras el Kharit. Striking
southward across the head of Wadi Kharit, it courses through the
mountains of Mikbi and Abu Gurdi, thence dropping to the south on
the plain near the hills called Marwot Elemikan. Turning here
sharply westward over the plain, it passes through the hill-mass of
Gebel Abu Derega and on to Gebel Zergat Naam, south-west of which
it crosses the low tract at the head of Wadi el Arned to the
sandstone plateaux of Dagalai, whence it courses a little to the
west of Gebel Um Reit and enters the mountainous tract of Gebel
Aqab el Negum. Its further course has not been traced in detail,
but from guides’ statements and the indications of the main
drainage-lines it is believed to run as shown on the map, in a
great curve through the two sharp peaks of Gebel Sheyenit to the
west of Gebel Mishbih, and then in another flatter curve
south-eastwards to Gebel Soaorib, at the head of Wadi Hasium.
Continuing along the mountain ridges of Gebel Soaorib, it
crosses<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span> to Gebel
Is,<a id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class=
"fnanchor">[36]</a> separating the Wadi Is from the heads of Wadi
Alaqi on the Sudan frontier.</p>

<p>The watershed is for a great part of its course quite impassable
for camels. The principal places where it can be crossed are at the
head of Wadi Nugrus, near Abu Had, the Wadi Marasan between Huluz
and Wadi el Sheikh, the heads of Wadi Lahami, Wadi el Fil, Wadi
Arned, and Wadi Um Reit, passes at Aqab el Negum and Hamrat el Feg,
near Gebel Mishbih, the head of Wadi Hasium, and the pass of Adar
Ameit, north of Gebel Is. All these places are practicable for
baggage camels, though in some of them, as, for instance, at the
head of Wadi Nugrus, care is required because the track is steep
and stony.</p>

<p>The principal drainage-basins are shown on the small scale map
on <a href="#pl02">Plate II.</a> The westward drainage ultimately
reaches the Nile by the three main trunk wadis of Shait, Kharit,
and Alaqi; Shait and Kharit enter the Nile Valley at Kom Ombo,
while Alaqi debouches near Dakka. The eastward drainage is much
more complex, the principal trunk wadis, such as Um Khariga, Gemal,
Khoda, Rahaba, Hodein, Ibib, Di-ib, and Serimtai, being separated
by very numerous minor wadis draining independently to the
sea.<a id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class=
"fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>Nearly all the wadis contain vegetation in the form of trees and
bushes, and plant life flourishes as a rule far more luxuriously in
wadis draining seawards than in those leading to the Nile. Feqoh,
Naam, and the lower reaches of Hodein are, however, exceptionally
barren. Forming, as they do, the only possible roads, furnishing
the entire supply of camel food, and containing most of the wells,
the wadis are to the desert what the Nile is to Egypt proper. The
intervening mountains are of no interest to the Arabs, except when
they contain water-reservoirs. Hence the place-naming starts from
the wadis, even the smallest of which have names unless they are
barren. Mountains are generally named after the nearest wadi, and
may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span> thus have two
names when situated between two wadis, the particular name used
depending on which side the mountain is seen from.</p>

<h3><a id="c02s04"></a>Coast-line.</h3>

<p>The coast-line of this part of Egypt is somewhat irregular, the
peninsula of Ras Benas forming a prominent projection in latitude
24°. In the south part of the area the eastward extension of the
country, culminating in Ras Hadarba (Cape Elba of existing maps),
is very marked, extending nearly to 37° of east longitude. The
coast is almost entirely fringed by coral reefs, passage through
which is only possible at certain points, and then only with the
utmost care in navigation.<a id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> Between the feet of the
mountains and the sea there extends a gently sloping plain, varying
in width from about eight to twenty-five kilometres, covered with
sand, over which the drainage meanders in shallow courses, often
only traceable by the vegetation which occurs along them. A rather
surprising result brought out by the levelling observations is that
the slope of the coast plain, even where it looks flattest and
sandiest, is as steep as the floors of some of the wadis draining
on to it, and several times more steep than the beds of the wadis
which drain westwards to the Nile, its fall seawards averaging six
metres per kilometre and reaching over ten metres per kilometre in
some sections.</p>

<h3><a id="c02s05"></a>Climate.</h3>

<p>The climate of the district is predominantly hot and dry to the
west of the watershed, hot and moist eastward of it; but very cold
weather is apt to prevail for a few weeks in January and February,
with strong north winds, on both sides of the watershed, and the
transition from piercing cold to great heat at these times is often
brought about very suddenly by a change of wind direction. There is
seldom any frost, but water-bags are occasionally frozen on the
mountain tops at night. Cool north-west winds prevail in the north
part of the area, while hot damp winds from the south-east are
usual in the south. In the central part, round Berenice, absolute
calms<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span> are
frequent.<a id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class=
"fnanchor">[39]</a> The highest mountain-masses are frequently
swathed in clouds for weeks together, especially from January to
March. The hot, dry, sand-laden winds called <em>Khamsin</em>
occasionally blow for four or five days together in March and
April; at these times the shade temperature rises to over 45° C.,
and the air is thick with sand and dust. Rain falls in most years,
but its quantity is very variable; in some years there is barely
enough to keep the wells supplied, and much of the vegetation
withers; in others, heavy storms produce wild downrushes in the
wadis, filling them for short periods with raging torrents. Curious
electrical and optical phenomena can sometimes be seen on the
mountain-tops during storms and in mists.<a id=
"FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>
The Elba region is seldom free from clouds, and receives far more
rain than any other portion of the area, forming in fact the
northern limit of the rainy tropical zone; it is in consequence
relatively well wooded, while the other mountains are a dreary
waste of naked rocks.</p>

<h3><a id="c02s06"></a>Scenery.</h3>

<p>The predominant types of scenery are extensive sandy plains and
gaunt rugged mountains. In the low-lands, pleasant relief from the
stony monotony is afforded by the trees and scrub which occur along
most of the wadis, though their struggle for existence is often
evidenced by miles of withered and blackened scrub in places which
a few years ago were green and flourishing. The bareness of the
mountains becomes slightly relieved in the Elba district, where
beautiful trees and flowering plants thrive high up the
mountain-side along all the drainage lines. As to the forms of the
mountains, one sees extensive broken sandstone plateaux at Gebel
Abraq (<em>El</em>), remarkable rounded granite bosses at Gebels
Muelih (<em>Ab</em>), Nugrus (<em>Dc</em>), Selaia (<em>Fh</em>),
and Um Rasein (<em>Jr</em>), jagged and spiky granite peaks in the
mountains of Faraid (<em>Jk</em>), Qash Amir (<em>Os</em>), and
Elba (<em>Ps</em>), and broken masses of gneiss, dark schists and
serpentines at Gebels Hafafit (<em>Dc</em>), Hangalia
(<em>Dc</em>), Abu Hamamid (<em>Ef</em>), Hamata (<em>Gf</em>), and
Gerf<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span> (<em>Hp</em>).
Perhaps the most remarkable of all the peaks are those of Faraid
(<em>Jk</em>), which from the north look like the expanded fingers
of a huge hand, whence they received their name of <em>Mons
Pentadactylus</em> in antiquity, while one specially sharp peak is
styled very appropriately “the Bodkin” on Admiralty Charts. The
mass of Elba forms a very fine view from the north, but the
prevalence of clouds about its summits frequently hides it from
view for months together. The views from the mountain-tops are
extensive and beautiful, especially at sunrise and sunset, when the
peaks take on wonderful colours, and the views from the summits
when the entire lower landscape is bathed in clouds, through which
only the higher peaks project like islands from a great sea, are
not less remarkable. Though a good look out was kept from the
highest mountains across the sea, the mountains of the opposite
shore of Arabia were never with certainty made out; the cone of
Zeberged Island was, however, often seen. It is stated by
d’Anville, on the authority of Castro,<a id=
"FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>
that both the Arabian and African mountains can be seen from the
summit of Zeberged.</p>

<h3><a id="c02s07"></a>Animal and Plant Life.</h3>

<p>Both animal and plant life is mainly confined to the drainage
lines. Of wild animals suitable for human food, gazelles can be
shot fairly frequently in the south part of the area, but are very
scarce in the north. Sand grouse and partridges can occasionally be
obtained round Abu Saafa, while doves are very abundant in the
groves near Bir Akwamtra, at the foot of Gebel Elba. Ibex were
never seen with certainty, though their horns and lairs were often
found on the mountains. Conies inhabit the rocks near Bir Abraq and
Bir Madi. The wild ass has disappeared from the area, as also has
the ostrich, though fragments of ostrich eggs picked up here and
there, and drawings of this bird on the rocks, attest its presence
here in recent times. Vultures, kites, and ravens are everywhere in
evidence, and several kinds of smaller birds, such as swallows and
wagtails, are often seen about the greener wadis. Lizards of many
kinds are to be seen. Scorpions and snakes are seldom met with. Of
butterflies and moths, especially the latter, many varieties occur.
The common fly occurs in<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_25">[25]</span> such numbers as to be a great pest, but
mosquitoes and sand-flies are practically absent. Camel ticks
infest the ground under all trees used as shade by travelling
Arabs. Earwigs are in some places very abundant, and a great
variety of beetles and bugs occur. Near the sea, whole armies of
crabs are to be seen marching on the shore, and hermit crabs are
very numerous in all sorts of gasteropod dwellings.</p>

<p>Of plant life the district contains a great variety. The north
and central parts of the area contain the same trees and bushes as
abound further north in Egypt,<a id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> and camel food is
moderately abundant. As Elba is approached, many beautiful
flowering plants not found further north are met with, while in the
clefts of the slopes of Elba itself is a far richer vegetation than
occurs wild in any other part of Egypt. I found the approach to
Elba was stopped for baggage camels some four kilometres from the
summit owing to the closeness of the trees, and the ascent on foot
up the clefts of the mountain-face for the remainder of the way was
more like going through an English wood than up a desert mountain.
Many varieties of sweet-smelling flowers and some fruit-bearing
trees unfamiliar in Egypt were seen, while mosses and lichens
covered the tumbled masses of granite in many places. Schweinfurth,
who examined the botany of this region in 1864, found that of 300
species of plants collected in the Elba district, the vast majority
were of Abyssinian types; scarcely 100 were living in other more
northerly parts of the Eastern Desert of Egypt, while still fewer
are indigenous to the Nile Valley, and only fifteen species were of
those found wild in Europe.<a id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<h3><a id="c02s08"></a>Water Supplies.<a id=
"FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class=
"fnanchor">[44]</a></h3>

<p>The sources of water comprise <em>galts</em> (rock basins
forming rain water reservoirs in the mountains), springs and wells.
Of these, <em>galts</em> yield the purest water, and form the
principal supply of the pastoral Arabs, except in years of no
rainfall, while springs and wells, the latter usually rude
excavations in the alluvia of wadis, are most used by travellers
from their easier accessibility. Small <em>galts</em> are
called<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span> <em>megal</em>
(Ababda) or <em>megwel</em> (Bisharin); they are frequently
accompanied by small springs.</p>

<p>The small scale map on <a href="#pl03">Plate III,</a> which
shows all sources known to exist within the area, gives a good idea
of the distribution of water supplies. Water is scarce in the
western parts of the country, Bir Abu Hashim being the only source
within a radius of about sixty kilometres of itself, but
<em>galts</em> and wells are fairly frequent among the mountainous
tracts further east. The springs of Abraq and Abu Saafa are the
most important sources in the central area. The portion of the
country under the Sudan Administration is far richer in water that
the Egyptian part, containing numerous fine wells and springs, such
as Birs Meneiga, Abu Hodeid, Akwamtra, and Frukit. The coast plain
is waterless, except for salty wells near the sea.</p>

<p>Water can usually be obtained at intervals of about two or three
days when on the march, and in some parts much more frequently. The
water of certain wells and springs has a purgative effect due to
the absorption of magnesium salts, especially after a long interval
without rain. That of others, again, such as Muelih and Shalatein,
is so salty as to be only drinkable by camels.</p>

<h3><a id="c02s09"></a>Geology.<a id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></h3>

<p>The rocks composing this part of Egypt are principally igneous
and metamorphic deposits of very ancient origin. Granite is most
prominent in the Nugrus, Faraid, and Elba areas, schists and
diorites cover a large portion of the remaining country, and huge
masses of serpentines form the mountains of Abu Dahr, Korabkansi,
and Gerf. Of sedimentary rocks, plateaux of Nubian sandstone
(Cretaceous) cover large areas round Bir Abraq and westward of it,
while a narrow belt of the same rock also occurs along the sea
coast in the north part of the district. Gypseous limestones
(Miocene?) form the hills of Ras Benas and occur along the coast
north of Wadi Lahami, as well as in small areas near the coast
further south in the neighbourhood of Halaib.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>Crushing of the
older rocks is almost everywhere strongly evidenced, but faulting
is difficult to trace except in the sandstone areas, where it is
strongly marked. The presence of clearly defined overthrust
faulting in the Abraq area shows that tangential earth movements,
so rare in this part of the world,<a id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> have not been altogether
absent.</p>

<h3><a id="c02s10"></a>Mineral Products.</h3>

<p>The mineral resources of this part of Egypt are not of very
great importance, owing partly to its inaccessible situation and
desert character. Gold and copper ores occur in places; other
localities contain beryl and peridots, while others, again, bear
iron ores, gypsum, sulphur, steatite, asbestos, and magnesite, and
good building stones abound over large areas.</p>

<p>The presence of ruins and excavations at places like Hangalia,
Sikait, Zabara, Romit, and Darahib, are evidence of mining activity
in the past, but the mean nature of the accommodation for the
workers, and the presence of old stone hand mills where gold was
the thing sought for, confirm the statement of Diodorus<a id=
"FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>
that the mines were worked by miserable convicts.</p>

<p>In recent years much prospecting has been done to test whether
the ancient mines could be developed and made commercially
productive under modern conditions. In the case of many areas,
including that round Darahib, the mines of which are believed to be
those referred to with a map in the Turin papyrus of the Nineteenth
Dynasty,<a id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class=
"fnanchor">[48]</a> the prospecting licences have been surrendered
to the Government because the results were unfavourable. In a few
other cases prospecting is still being carried out, and in three
localities the results have been sufficiently encouraging for
exploitation to be undertaken.</p>

<p>The following tables, compiled from information supplied by the
Mines Department, give particulars of the prospecting
licences<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span> and mining
leases at present (1912) held within the area described in this

<p>Of the above three mining leases, the last mentioned (the
Peridot and Egyptian Gems Co., Ltd.) is the only one under which
any considerable exploitation has been carried on, large numbers of
beautiful peridots having been obtained from the mines. The two
gold mining undertakings have been commenced too recently for much
to have been as yet accomplished.</p>

<h3><a id="c02s11"></a>Antiquities.</h3>

<p>The archæological remains of pre-Arab times in this part of
Egypt comprise the small ruined temples of Berenice and Sikait, the
ruins of stations along the old mining roads, the ancient mines
with the rude habitations of the miners, and sundry markings on
rocks near the roads.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>The <span class=
"bold">Temple of Berenice</span> is a low inconspicuous structure
measuring only some ten metres square, containing five small rooms
and a tiny corridor and staircase.<a id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> Owing to its exposed
situation on the coast and the soft limestone (from Ras Benas) of
which it is built, it is in a very dilapidated condition, and it is
difficult to make out many of the inscriptions on its walls. The
axial direction of the temple (63° 20′ east of true north) appears
to show that it was oriented to face the rising sun at the summer
solstice. Of the village (one can hardly call it a city) of
Berenice, only insignificant remains exist near the temple. The
houses were mere hovels built of rough lumps of coral.</p>

<p>There are three <span class="bold">temples in Wadi
Sikait</span>; they are small rock-hewn structures in even worse
preservation than that of Berenice.<a id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p class="space-above15">Many attempts have been made to trace the
<span class="bold">ancient mining roads</span> mentioned by
classical writers. The stations on the road from <em>Koptos</em>
(Quft) to Berenice, enumerated by Pliny and Antoninus, have not
been with certainty identified. The absence of any reliable map of
the main features of the country has hitherto prevented travellers
from locating the positions of stations found, while in careful
surveying it has generally been necessary to travel by other roads
than the ancient ones, so that it cannot be hoped that all the
ruined stations, many of which are invisible till one is close to
them, have been included in the maps. Now that all the principal
features of the country have been accurately laid down, it will be
much easier for future travellers to locate precisely any ruins
they may come across.</p>

<p>Of the road leading from <em>Contra-Apollinopolis</em> (Edfu) to
the emerald mines of Sikait and Zabara, much more is known, this
route having been traversed by Golénischeff<a id=
"FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
and most of its stations located by the Geological Survey. Leading
from Edfu, past Bir Abad, the ruins of a large station and rock
temple occur at a distance of about forty-five kilometres from the
Nile, at a place now called <em>Kanais</em> (the churches), where a
well yielding good water was sunk three years ago by the Mines
Department. About forty-five kilometres<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_30">[30]</span> further on is the station called Gariat Abu
Medrik, where there are two ancient stucco-lined cylindrical
reservoirs, but no well. At the next station, called Samut, there
is a good well in the centre of a large rubble ruin. As all the
stations just mentioned lie outside the limits of the maps which
accompany this memoir, I give their approximate geographical
positions below:—</p>

<p>The next station after Samut appears to have been the ruins near
Gebel Dweig. Further on, after passing over the watershed, is
another station with two cisterns in a semicircular enclosure. The
road continues past Gebel Abu Had to the Wadi Gemal, where there
are two more cisterns, this time in a triangular enclosure, and
thence up to the Wadi Nugrus and Wadi Sikait to the mines. The
Edfu-Sikait road may have joined the Quft-Berenice road at the Wadi
Gemal station.</p>

<p>A third ancient road is believed to have led northward from
Berenice to Qoseir, along the coast; while a fourth, from near
Dakka on the Nile up the Wadi Alaqi to the gold mines of the south,
is now a regular route to the Nile Valley Company’s mine of Um
Gariart.</p>

<p class="space-above15">The <span class="bold">ancient emerald
mines of Zabara and Sikait</span> consist of numerous irregular
shafts, mostly of no very great depth, excavated in schists of
micaceous and talcose types. The <span class="bold">old gold
mines</span>, such as those at Sukari, Um Eleiga, Seiga, Romit, and
the Darahib district, are on a considerable scale, excavations
having been carried on in quartz veins to fair depths. The
dwellings at the mines were for the most part only miserable hovels
of rubble stone. A view of those of Um Eleiga is given on <a href=
"#pl04">Plate IV.</a> The ancient quartz-grinding mills, mostly
made of a hard diorite, are frequently found among the ruins of the
hovels. There is no clear evidence that any of the
mines<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span> yielded a very
rich output; the workings were of the nature of penal settlements
(Prof. Mahaffy<a id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class=
"fnanchor">[52]</a> has aptly termed them a “tropical Siberia”) in
times when life and labour were cheap, and a very moderate yield
may under those conditions have been satisfactory.<a id=

</div>

<p class="space-above15">Besides those at the mining camps and
stations, there are some other extensive collections of ruins in
the district, two of the most considerable being at Shenshef and
Bir Meneiga. The <span class="bold">ruins at Shenshef</span>
(<em>see</em> <a href="#pl04">Plate IV</a>) are in part those of
well-built houses, furnished with doors and windows, formed of
slabs of fissile quartzose schist, quarried in the neighbouring
hills. There are wells at Shenshef, but apparently no mines; the
presence of watch towers on the hills, and the peculiar situation
of the place, suggest that it may have been a slave dealer’s
stronghold where slaves were herded till they could be shipped from
Berenice. The better houses may have been those of the overseers,
while the ruder hovels accommodated the slaves, and sentinels at
the watch towers prevented any attempt at escape. The <span class=
"bold">ruins at Bir Meneiga</span>, though extensive, are very
rude, and probably only represent a camping ground near the
springs. A large rubble enclosure near Abraq springs has been
thought by Purdy<a id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54"
class="fnanchor">[54]</a> to have been a hunting station of the
Ptolemies.</p>

<p class="space-above15">In many places there are <span class=
"bold">marks and drawings on the rocks</span> near roads. These are
frequently spirited representations of animals, among which the
ostrich is often seen. At the Galt el Aguz, near the watershed at
the head of one of the branches of Wadi Garara, the drawings are
accompanied by rude Greek inscriptions. At Abu Saafa, one of the
springs issues from a niche cut in the sandstone, having a carved
cornice with the remains of a Greek inscription on it.</p>

<p class="space-above15">Another class of remains are found
scattered over the area in the form of <span class=
"bold">cylindrical rubble piles</span>, four metres in diameter and
from one to two metres high. The natives consider these to be tombs
of pre-Arab date.</p>

<p class="space-above15"><span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_32">[32]</span>Of <span class="bold">Arab tombs</span> in the
area, the most considerable is that of Sheikh Shadli, near Gebel
Abu Hamamid, a view of which is shown on <a href="#pl05">Plate
V.</a> It is a well-built tomb of several domes, inhabited by a
Moorish guardian. A yearly pilgrimage is made to this place by the
Ababda Arabs, who hold the memory of Shadli in high veneration. The
next largest tomb is probably that of Sheikh Hamid, near Abraq
springs. Near the nose of Ras Benas is a large sheikh’s tomb, where
sailors perform their devotions, and smaller tombs of the same
type, built of drift-wood, are to be seen at other points near the
coast. Cemeteries of small Arab graves exist near every well and
spring.</p>

<h3><a id="c02s12"></a>Inhabitants.</h3>

<p>The South-Eastern Desert of Egypt is inhabited by nomad Arabs of
the various Ababda and Bisharin tribes.<a id=
"FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>
Ababda (Ashabab and Meleikab) occupy the country north of Muqsim
and Bir Shalatein, while Bisharin (Hamedorab, Kurbeilab, Koatil,
and Balgab) inhabit the country to the south.<a id=
"FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>
Only guesses are available as to their numbers, but it is not
probable that they comprise so much as one inhabitant for each five
square kilometres. A casual journey through the country would lead
one to think that it was inhabited to an even less degree, but the
Arabs mostly camp in selected narrow wadis out of sight of the
traveller. They are a people of good physique, hardy, intelligent,
and fair workers if once their employer knows how to handle them.
They share, however, in the universal Bedouin dislike to protracted
regular work; after a few months of regular routine, even the
semi-nomad routine of a survey-expedition, they experience strong
desires for their own independent roaming life, and it is
impossible to retain them for longer periods. Many of the Ababda
who are settled near the Nile have lost their true desert
character, and on desert expeditions men of this class are far less
satisfactory than nomads; they do not know the country, but fear
the desert and are continually desirous of returning to the valley.
The better desert guides, on the other hand, love the wilderness,
and they have a perfectly marvellous geographic instinct. The
skeleton on which they arrange their knowledge is always the system
of drainage. If<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span> a map
of their country is laid before them, and a few points named to
them, they will delight in tracing out and naming all the wadis and
peaks. But they have very vague ideas of proportion, and can only
read a map when it is laid on the ground in its true orientation
with respect to the meridian. The Ababda are generally regarded as
the best type of Egyptian desert Arab, while my experience of the
Bisharin of the Elba district is that they are superior, in
industry, intelligence, truthfulness, and orderliness, to the
Ababda.<a id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class=
"fnanchor">[57]</a> It is, however, necessary either to understand
the Bishari tongue, or to have men who can interpret into Arabic,
as the great mass of the Bisharin understand only their own
language, which is quite different from Arabic.<a id=
"FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>
Education is very backward, but there is a <em>kuttab</em>
(elementary school) at Halaib, where instruction in Arabic reading
and writing is given to boys. All the Arabs are of course Moslems,
but they are not at all fanatical.</p>

<p>The manner of life of the Arabs is very simple. Most of the men
have only a single cotton wrap about their middle, though some wear
the ordinary galabia and cotton drawers. Their camps are rude tents
of matting about two metres in diameter, but the men commonly sleep
in the open, sheltering themselves from winds by their camel
saddles, covered only with their cotton wrap, which they spread
over their entire bodies, including their heads. They wear no head
covering, having heavy “mops” of curled black hair plentifully
supplied with mutton fat. Their food consists almost entirely of
milk and meat, of which their flocks and herds give them a
plentiful supply; they eat but little bread, but they are fond of a
kind of gruel of flour and water, and of dates, which are imported
from Arabia <em>via</em> Suakin. Only a few of them smoke tobacco,
and that generally in soapstone pipes which they carve out for
themselves. Intoxicants are unknown amongst true desert Arabs. For
arms, they carry swords and knives, seldom fire-arms. Of their
tribal customs, I saw but little; Linant de Bellefonds gives an
interesting account of them in his “L’Etbaye.” On festive
occasions, camel-racing and dancing are favourite amusements.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>Slavery appears to
be non-existent at present, for in the course of my twenty months’
wanderings I received no complaint under this head, as I should
almost certainly have done had any oppressive servitude
existed.</p>

<h3><a id="c02s13"></a>Languages.</h3>

<p>My own study of the Ababda and Bishari tongues has been mainly
confined to their geographical terms. The Ababda nowadays almost
all speak Arabic, and most of their place-names are either Arabic
or closely akin to it. A marked feature of their tongue is a
fondness for diminutives. Thus we have <em>Sellim</em> and
<em>Seleim</em>, <em>Hafafit</em> and <em>Hefeifit</em>,
<em>Faraid</em>, and <em>Fereyid</em>, <em>Wadi</em> and
<em>Wadai</em>, in each of which the second of the pair is a
diminutive formed by vowel-change, generally accompanied by a
change in the placing of the stress. The commonest special
geographical terms in Ababda country are: <em>erf</em>, a ridge;
<em>rod</em>, a tributary wadi; <em>talet</em>, a small tributary
wadi; <em>kab</em>, a watershed or pass; <em>hamrat</em>, a (red)
granite mountain; <em>zergat</em>, a black mountain; <em>galt</em>,
a rock basin containing rain water; and <em>megal</em>, a small
water hole. Thus we have such names as <em>Hamrat Selma</em>,
<em>Zergat Naam</em>, and so on, the name often giving a clue to
the nature of the rock.</p>

<p>As soon as one passes into Bisharin country the change in the
nature of place-names is very striking. The definite article is no
longer <em>el</em>, but <em>o</em>, <em>u</em>, <em>ei</em>,
<em>e</em> (masc.), and <em>to</em>, <em>tu</em>, <em>tei</em>,
<em>ti</em> (fem.). Many place-names end in <em>ai</em> and
<em>oi</em>. The principal geographical terms are: <em>kwan</em>, a
wadi; <em>da-aiyob</em>, a depression from which there is no
drainage outlet; <em>aweib</em> and <em>riba</em>, a mountain;
<em>kulet</em>, a hill; <em>megwel</em>, a water hole;
<em>adar</em>, red; <em>hadal</em>, black; <em>sotai</em>, green;
<em>eire</em>, white; <em>sarara</em>, deep; <em>salala</em>,
rather deep (applied to wells). Hence we get such combinations as:
<em>Hadal Aweib Meisah</em>, the black mountain near Wadi Meisah;
<em>Eir Arib</em>, the white (granite) rock; <em>Sarobi Kwan</em>,
the wadi where the Sarob plant (<i>Capparis sodada</i>) grows;
<em>Bir Sararat Seyet</em>, the deep well in Wadi Seyet, and so on.
A mountain called <em>adar</em> is generally of red granite, while
one called <em>hadal</em> is usually diorite or serpentine.
<em>Asotriba</em>, the green mountain south of Gebel Elba, receives
its name from the vegetation on it.</p>

<h3><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span><a id=
"c02s14"></a>Industries.</h3>

<p>The principal industries carried on by the desert Arabs are the
rearing of camels, sheep and goats, especially the first-named. The
Bisharin devote much attention to camel-breeding, and supply many
animals annually to the Coast Guard Administration. Their camels
are very superior animals, and need to be hardy in order to
negotiate the steep mountain passes of their country. Sheep and
goats can be bought cheaply in the south, and are driven in to
Aswân for sale at the higher rates there prevailing. It is common
to find a flock of hundreds of sheep being watered at wells such as
Bir Abu Hashim and Qoleib on the route to Kom Ombo; but many
animals drop and die on the weary march from well to well.</p>

<p>Charcoal burning has been practised, especially in the Ababda
country, but is not much carried on now; this industry deserves
strong opposition, for it only impoverishes the country, and the
<em>seyal</em> trees are few enough for the support of camels in
years of drought.</p>

<p>In recent years some employment has been found for the Arabs by
prospectors for mining companies, both as miners and for
camel-transport, and they are occasionally, as in the present
expedition, employed on Government work.</p>

<p>For the information of future travellers, it may be worth while
to mention the prices paid for local labour on the survey
expeditions. The men and animals were all the best obtainable of
their particular class, and the prices include saddles and fodder
for camels, their own provision of water and food for the men, and,
in the case of sheikhs, postmen, and guides, their riding camels
and fodder:—</p>

<p>A small amount of agriculture is practised in the Wadi Di-ib,
slightly south of the Sudan frontier, but there is none actually
within<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span> the district
here described. My camels were fed for some time on <em>durra</em>
(Indian corn) brought from Wadi Di-ib.</p>

<p>A little fishing is carried on near Berenice and at Mersa Shab
and Halaib, but only for the food of the fishermen, who subsist
almost entirely on it, and thus recall the <em>Ichthyophages</em>
of Ptolemy. When I had abundance of excellent fish at Shab and
Halaib, I noticed that but few of my Bisharin cared to partake of
what was to me a very welcome change of diet.</p>

<p>Halaib is the only permanent village, and even it is merely a
miserable collection of wooden huts and tents, where trade is
confined to dates, fat, corn, sugar, and such like necessaries;
supplies are brought by boat from Suakin and sold to the local
Arabs.</p>

<h3><a id="c02s15"></a>Communications.</h3>

<p>There are numerous camel-roads connecting the various wells with
each other and with the Nile, the principal of which are indicated
on <a href="#pl03">Plate III</a> (p. 26). The most usual starting
points from the valley are Edfu, Kom Ombo, Aswân, Dakka, and
Berber. The roads lie mostly along wadis, and are far from being
very direct, being necessarily so chosen as to pass water supplies
and to avoid very steep places. From Aswân or Kom Ombo, Berenice
can be reached in about seven or eight days by luggage camels, and
the roads are fairly good; water is least scarce on the Kom Ombo
road, which takes advantage of the wells of Qoleib and Abu Hashim.
Between any two wells, there are generally several possible roads.
The one taken by any particular traveller is naturally that which
his guides happen to know best, or that along which the most camel
food is to be found at the time; hardly any two Europeans have
journeyed by precisely the same road. A “road” in desert parlance
is only a track by which camels have passed at some time or other;
there is nothing of the nature of a <em>made</em> road, even along
the ancient routes mentioned in the Antonine Itinerary; and the
tracks are sometimes obliterated by sand. Since the opening up of
Port Sudan, the Elba district is most easily reached from that
place, whence it is about 340 kilometres distant, by two roads of
nearly equal length, one skirting the coast and the other more
inland; the latter passes good wells at about two<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span> days’ intervals.<a id=
"FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>
To reach Elba from the valley, a camel journey of more than 500
kilometres is necessary whether Aswân, Dakka, or Berber be the
starting point. The ports of Berenice, Shab, and Halaib are only
touched occasionally and irregularly by coasting boats and Coast
Guard steamers. News is passed orally among the wandering Arabs
with remarkable rapidity, but naturally it frequently gets somewhat
modified in transit.</p>

<h3><a id="c02s16"></a>Government.</h3>

<p>The geographical frontier between Egypt and the Sudan is the
22nd parallel of north latitude. But for administrative purposes it
has been found convenient to consider all Bisharin Arabs as under
the Sudan Government, and all Ababda under that of Egypt. The
administrative frontier therefore runs between the districts of the
two main tribal divisions, along a zigzag line from Gebel Muqsim,
<em>via</em> Gebel Um el Tiur el Foqani, Gebel Niqrub el Foqani,
and Bir Meneiga, to Bir Shalatein on the coast.<a id=
"FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>
A territory of some 16,000 square kilometres in the extreme
south-east corner of Egypt is thus placed for purposes of
government under the Sudan mudiria of Berber, under which
arrangement a moawin and small police force are maintained in the
fort of Halaib. The remainder of the area is administered by the
Egyptian mudir of Aswân. In Egypt, the Arabs are not taxed except
in respect of any lands they may own in the Nile Valley. In the
Sudan a tax is levied on each tribe in return for police protection
and other advantages; the tax is paid very willingly, for the
Bisharin are less poor than the Ababda, and thoroughly appreciate
the advantage of good government, while they have unbounded faith
in the justice of Anglo-Egyptian officials in settling their
disputes. One of the incidents which most strongly impressed itself
on my remembrance during my travels in the district was the meeting
near Gebel Korabkansi of an English inspector from Berber, to whom
a number of Bisharin Arabs engaged in disputes stated their rival
claims quietly and reasonably, both sides having the utmost
confidence that the judgment given would be just and fair. In
Egypt,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span> the Arabs are
less friendly in their feelings towards the government, and prefer
to settle their differences among themselves; a circumstance no
doubt due to the fact that Egyptian governors have had their hands
full with matters connected with the valley, and have had no time
to become acquainted with Bedouin ideas and customs, while the
Arabs, independent for centuries and very poor, are afraid of
misunderstanding and taxation. It would, I think, be unfair to tax
the true desert Arabs of Egypt, even to the moderate extent which
is done for the Arabs of the Sudan, for their country is much more
barren than that of the Bisharin, and their sources of income are
consequently fewer. In a year of little or no rainfall, there is
not enough vegetation to feed their animals, so that many are lost,
and the only way a tax could be raised at such times would be by
cutting down trees for charcoal; but, as already mentioned, any
encouragement of the charcoal industry would soon impoverish the
country still further, the thorny acacia trees being the principal
reserve camel food in rainless years. That so many Ababda are
settled in and near the Nile Valley is possibly in part due to
their having been driven from the desert by the growing scarcity of
trees consequent on the prosecution of the charcoal industry in the
past.</p>

<h3>Triangulation.</h3>

<p><span class="bold">Base-Lines</span>—The triangulation was
commenced by measuring a base line<a id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> near Gebel Muelih by means
of a 100-metre steel tape, which had been previously standardised
at the Khedivial Observatory. A level tract having been selected,
in such a position as to afford easy connection with points already
triangulated from the Nile Valley, a line about two and a half
kilometres long was ranged out, along which wooden pegs were driven
flush with the ground at 100-metre intervals. The inequalities of
the ground between the pegs were levelled off by tiny embankments
and cuttings, so as to enable the tape to lie flat. On each peg was
nailed a zinc plate having a millimetre scale running in the
direction of the line. In measuring, the tape was laid on the
ground, stretched to a constant tension by a spring balance at each
end, in such manner that its end marks fell on the zinc scales, and
readings were simultaneously taken on the scales at the two ends.
Temperatures were taken in several places along the tape by
mercurial thermometers. The operation of measurement was carried
out in the early morning, so as to avoid any large difference of
temperature between the ground and the air. The levels of the pegs
were found by spirit levelling. After correction for the initial
error of the tape, temperature, stretch, and inclination, the true
length of the base-line reduced to sea-level was found, as the mean
of two separate measurements at different tensions, to be 2,482·280
metres. The azimuth of the line was found by observations of
<em>Polaris</em> at elongation to be 30° 30′ 6″ E. of N. The
geographical position of the west end of the line was found by
triangulation-connexion with the Nile Valley by Mr. Villiers Stuart
to be latitude 24° 53′ 36″·7 N., longitude 34° 4′ 17″·9 E.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>A second connexion
to a base-line was made near Gebel Um Harba, where a base had been
previously measured by Mr. Villiers Stuart in the course of his
triangulation of the western part of the desert. In this case the
connexion was not made to the actual base-line, but to another main
line tied directly on to it. The data at this point of connexion
from the two triangulations afforded a useful check on the accuracy
of the work, and were as follows:—</p>

<p><span class="bold">Reconnaissance for triangulation
points</span> was carried out simultaneously with the triangulation
itself. The distance of likely looking peaks was determined either
by intersecting them from distant stations, or by special small
triangulations from short bases, and such selection made as seemed
most likely to secure well shaped figures and a good command of
surrounding country. As a rule, the highest summits were selected
as main (occupied) stations, while all other prominent peaks and
other features were fixed by intersection from two or more main
stations. The form adopted for the main triangulation net was a
series of quadrilateral figures with diagonals, combined with
centric polygons, all the angles of the figures being generally
measured. The average length of side was about thirty-five
kilometres.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Beacons.</span>—Main stations were marked by
wrought-iron beacons, consisting of two lengths of stove piping
about 15 centimetres diameter by 1½ metres long, the upper length
fitting into a faucet made by splaying out the lower tube. Near the
top of the tube were affixed four sheet iron wings, bolted on to
angle iron cleats. A conical cairn of stones was built up round the
tube, nearly up to the wings, so that the beacon when erected was
about three metres high, two metres in diameter across the base of
the cairn, and about a metre wide across the wings. The beacons
were taken down while a station was being occupied, and replaced on
leaving.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>Intersected points
were sometimes marked with a beacon or cairn, but in general the
peaks were simply bisected from several stations, as it was found
that this gave sufficiently accurate results.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Measurement of Horizontal
Angles.</span>—Angles were measured with a 6-inch theodolite
furnished with reading microscopes graduated to 10″ and permitting
of reliable estimations to 1″. The angles between main points were
read on four arcs to eliminate circle errors. Intersected points
were observed on one arc only. The average error of closure of main
triangles was 3″·3.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Field Computation and Plotting of
Triangulated Points.</span>—The triangles were computed by the
ordinary method, but the angles were rounded off to 10″ to enable
the sines to be taken direct from the logarithmic tables, and the
logarithms were only taken to five places. The length of the sides
having been thus found, the geographical positions were found by
the ordinary <em>L M Z</em> computation, using, however, only two
latitude terms and 5-place logarithms, while azimuths were only
taken out to the nearest 10″. The abbreviated form of computation
used will be best illustrated by an example:—<a id=

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>In the above, it
will be noticed that the azimuth is always noted as so much east or
west of north or south. If this convention be adopted, one may
consider the first term of <span class=
"letter-spaced01"><em>d</em>φ</span> as always +, and the second
term will be + if the azimuth contains the word south,—if it is
from the north, while the total <span class=
"letter-spaced01"><em>d</em>φ</span> is to be added or subtracted
according as one is going north or south. A somewhat similar
convention is adopted in neglecting the sign of <span class=
"letter-spaced01"><em>d</em>λ</span> till the actual addition or
subtraction is made. It was found in the field that this method
prevented any mistake of sign, while being much simpler to work
than one involving angles greater than 90°.</p>

<p>The geographical coordinates thus found were plotted directly on
to the plane-table sheets, on which the graticule at 10′ intervals
was the first thing drawn. The odd minutes and seconds were first
converted into minutes and decimals, and then into kilometres by
multiplying by the factors appropriate to the latitude, so that the
plotting could be done by the ordinary scale of kilometres. To
avoid difficulties of paper-shrinkage, as many points as possible
were plotted at the time of drawing the graticule, and in general
the points had to be plotted as far ahead as possible for
controlling the traversing and sketching.</p>

<p class="space-above15"><span class="bold">Astronomical
Observations.</span>—Astronomical checks on the triangulation were
obtained by observations of latitude at certain selected main
stations 60-120 kilometres apart, and by azimuth observations for
certain main lines.</p>

<p>The method used for <span class="bold">latitude</span> was that
of observing the times of equal altitudes of three or more stars,
selected as near to the meridian<a id="FNanchor_64"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> as possible. This method
presents great advantages over the usual <em>Polaris</em> and
circummeridian altitudes, in that the observations are more easily
made, and yield much more accurate results, because uncertainties
in refraction are largely eliminated and the errors of circle
graduation are not involved, the altitudes not being read at
all.<a id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class=
"fnanchor">[65]</a> The theodolite used was the same as was
employed in triangulation,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_43">[43]</span> and the times were taken by a half
chronometer watch, preferably one marking sidereal time with a rate
which could be considered negligible during the hour or so occupied
by the observation. The first star taken was usually
<em>Polaris</em>, and the vertical circle was left clamped at its
altitude. For the other stars, any dislevelment was corrected by
touching up the levelling screws just before the instant of
observation; this was found better, than taking bubble readings and
correcting for slight difference of altitude.</p>

<p>The method which I found best in the field for reducing the
observations differs somewhat from that described by Chauvenet.
Assuming approximate values for the latitude and watch error, I
first calculated the altitude of each star from the formula</p>

<div class="linegrp-container">
<div class="linegrp">
<div class="line">sin <em>h</em> = sin φ sin ε + cos φ cos δ cos
<em>t</em></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>If the assumed latitude and watch error were correct, all the
stars would give the same value for <em>h</em>. If not, each star
would give an equation of the form</p>

<div class="linegrp-container">
<div class="linegrp">
<div class="line"><em>h</em> + cos <em>A</em> <span class=
"letter-spaced01"><em>d</em>φ</span> + cos φ sin <em>A</em>
<em>dT</em> − <em>h</em><sub>0</sub> = 0</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="nind">where <em>A</em> is the star’s azimuth,
<span class="letter-spaced01"><em>d</em>φ</span> the required
correction to the assumed latitude, <em>dT</em> the required
correction to the assumed watch times, and <em>h</em><sub>0</sub>
the true altitude common to the three stars. The values of cos
<em>A</em> and cos φ sin <em>A</em> were calculated from the
ordinary formula</p>

<div class="linegrp-container">
<div class="linegrp">
<div class="line">sin <em>A</em> = <span class=
"fraction"><span class="numerator">cos δ sin
<em>t</em></span><span class="denominator">cos
<em>h</em></span></span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="nind">by four-place logarithms (using the approximate
values for φ, <em>t</em>, and <em>h</em>, since these are quite
sufficiently accurate for the purpose) and inserted into the three
star-equations.<a id="FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66"
class="fnanchor">[66]</a> By then solving the three simultaneous
equations for <span class="letter-spaced01"><em>d</em>φ</span>, the
required correction to the assumed latitude was at once
obtained.</p>

<p>As the method is one not usually treated of in books on
practical astronomy, I give on the following pages the reduction of
an observation worked out in full.</p>

<p class="space-above1">It may be remarked that the above process
was considerably shortened when it was possible to get a pair of
observations on the same south star both east and west of the
meridian, instead of on two separate south stars. In that case the
watch error was found at once from the difference between the
star’s R.A. and the mean of the two observed times, and the
latitude could be found from two equations instead of three. The
condition for this modification of the method was that a nautical
almanac star could be found culminating at an altitude slightly
greater than that of <em>Polaris</em> at a time convenient for the
observation. It is not advisable to select a star which would give
too long an interval between the equal east and west altitudes. The
best results are obtainable when the interval between the two
observations of the south star is about an hour, and
when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span> <em>Polaris</em>
is near its transit. Under such circumstances the watch correction
is obtained quite nearly enough for a good latitude; for, as
Gauss<a id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class=
"fnanchor">[67]</a> pointed out, “the essential condition is not so
much that the precise instant when the star reaches a supposed
place should be noted, as that at the time which is noted the star
should not be sensibly distant from that place.”</p>

<p>The following table shows the latitudes found by observation and
triangulation at the various points. It may be remarked that the
method used for latitude determination was liable to observational
errors of 2″ or so, as well as to errors of possibly more than
double that amount due to plumb-line deflection among the
mountains,<a id="FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68" class=
"fnanchor">[68]</a> so that the observed latitudes were only taken
as checks to prevent any gross error in triangulation being
overlooked, and not for any determination of the figure of the
earth, for which latter purpose more elaborate observations would
have been necessary.</p>

<p>The observed azimuths, unlike the observed latitudes, were more
accurate than the results of triangulation, repetition having shown
them to be reliable within 2″ or 3″, an error of which magnitude
would soon be surpassed in the process of continuing a chain of
azimuths with the unadjusted values of the angles of the triangles,
which were the only values possible to be used in the field. On
arriving at an azimuth station, therefore, a fresh chain of
azimuths was begun from the results of the observation, and
continued to the next station where astronomical observations were
undertaken. The accumulated azimuth error was, however, never found
to exceed 10″ in any chain, a quantity which could not sensibly
affect the computed positions of points for plotting on the
maps.</p>

<p class="space-above15"><span class="bold">Connexion with the
Sudan Surveys.</span>—At the south end of the area, connexion was
made to a number of points triangulated by the Sudan Surveys, but
as the Sudan triangulation was commenced as an independent piece of
work from an observed latitude and a telegraphically determined
longitude, the connexion affords no check on the accuracy of the
triangulations. The difference found between my positions and those
of the Sudan Surveys was practically constant for all the Sudan
points connected, and amounted to 3″·5 in latitude and 26″ in
longitude<a id="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70" class=
"fnanchor">[70]</a>; these figures represent the errors in the
assumed latitude and longitude of the starting point of the Sudan
Surveys,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span> and will be
employed as corrections to the Sudan positions now that a complete
chain of triangulation connects Berber with the Mediterranean.</p>

<p class="space-above15"><span class="bold">Levels of Triangulation
Points.</span>—The altitudes above sea-level of all triangulation
points were determined by vertical angular measurements carried out
at the occupied stations, an actual sea-level datum being obtained
by including rocks awash in the sea among the triangulated points.
To secure constancy of atmospheric refraction as far as possible,
vertical angles were always read in the middle of the day, where
the change of refraction is slowest. For the occupied stations,
refraction and curvature were eliminated by reciprocal
observations. For intersected points the formula <em>h</em> =
<em>d</em> <em>tan</em> θ + <span class="fraction"><span class=
"numerator">1 − <em>k</em></span><span class=
"denominator">2<em>r</em></span></span><em>d</em><sup>2</sup> was
used, the value of <em>d</em> tan θ being first found by
five-figure logarithms and then that of the curvature and
refraction correction <span class="fraction"><span class=
"numerator">1 − <em>k</em></span><span class=
"denominator">2<em>r</em></span></span><em>d</em><sup>2</sup> by
means of the very convenient “Universal” slide rule of
Nessler.<a id="FNanchor_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71" class=
"fnanchor">[71]</a> The value of <em>k</em> found from a discussion
of the first few reciprocal observations was found to be very
nearly 0·13, corresponding with the mean of European
determinations, and this value for the coefficient was employed
throughout the work for intersected points.<a id=
"FNanchor_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>
For obtaining the correction <span class="fraction"><span class=
"numerator">1 − <em>k</em></span><span class=
"denominator">2<em>r</em></span></span><em>d</em><sup>2</sup> by
the slide rule, a mark <em>R</em> was scratched at 1210<a id=
"FNanchor_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>
on the lower scale of the slide; by bringing this mark <em>R</em>
opposite to the distance (in kilometres) on the lower scale (or,
where the logarithm of the distance was more convenient, by
bringing the mark vertically under that logarithm on the log scale
of the rule<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span> by means
of the cursor) the correction could be read off directly on the
lowest fixed scale opposite the end-graduation of the slide.
Usually four or five values for the altitude of a single point were
obtained from a corresponding number of stations, and the mean
taken; the various values generally agreed within two metres.</p>

<p>The constant combination of vertical angular measurements with
horizontal ones was of great service from another point of view
from that of providing altitude data for the maps. It frequently
happened that a peak observed at one station could not be
identified among a number of similar peaks visible at another
station. When this trouble arose, the vertical angles offered a way
out of the difficulty. Vertical and horizontal angles were read off
to a number of likely-looking peaks; on working out the triangles
to the nearest minute of the observed angles, the distance of each
peak was obtained on the assumption that it was the one required.
Then to find which of the several peaks was the correct one, the
elevations were worked out, assuming the distances correct; in only
one case would the level agree from the two stations, and this
obviously discriminated the peak required. The working out of the
triangles for this purpose could be done with sufficient accuracy
in a very few minutes by means of the slide rule, and many points
were thus saved from rejection consequent on misidentification.</p>

<p>Checks on absolute level were frequently obtained by observing
depression angles to the sea horizon, using the formula θ = 107·8
√<span class="overline">&nbsp;<em>h</em>&nbsp;,</span> where θ is
in seconds of arc and <em>h</em> is the altitude in metres. But for
high stations the horizon is so distant that very small variations
in refraction cause rather large errors in the result, so that this
method only furnished a rough check.</p>

<h3>Summary of Triangulated Positions.</h3>

<p>The following tables give the geographical positions and
altitudes above sea-level of all points triangulated, arranged in
order of diminishing latitude, <em>i.e.</em>, from north to south.
The list includes the points fixed within the Sudan for connexion
with the Sudan Surveys. Stations occupied are indicated by an
asterisk against the number of the point. It will be noticed that
in some cases several different mountains bear the same name though
widely distant from each other; also that where a single mountain
mass possesses several peaks or summits, each of these has been
fixed separately.</p>

<h3><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>Comparison of
Positions determined on the Red Sea with those previously found in
Official Marine Surveys.</h3>

<p>It is interesting to compare the positions found for certain
triangulation points with those determined by the British Admiralty
surveyors and by Lieut. Koss, who accompanied the Austrian
research-ship “Pola” in 1895-6.<a id="FNanchor_74"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> The three best defined
points of comparison are Berenice temple, the central peak of St.
John’s Island, and Halaib Fort. In the case of Berenice and St.
John’s Island the observation of the two prior surveys were made at
stations a little distance from my triangulation points, but the
published charts enable one to scale off the necessary corrections
to reduce the positions to those of the triangulated points. At
Berenice, the British Admiralty observation point, for which the
latitude is given as 23° 56′ 16″, is 1′ 26″ north of the temple, so
that the equivalent Admiralty latitude for the temple is 23° 54′
50″. Similarly Lieut. Koss’s observation point, where the latitude
found was 23° 56′ 27″, is 1′ 47″ north of the temple, giving the
latitude of the temple as 23° 54′ 40″. My triangulation gives the
latitude of the temple as 23° 54′ 39″, thus showing a remarkably
good agreement with that found by the “Pola” observer.</p>

<p>At St. John’s Island, owing to the smallness of the scale of the
available charts, it is a little more difficult to scale off
accurately the Admiralty position for the peak and the reduction to
the peak of Lieut. Koss’s point. As nearly as I can scale, the
Admiralty latitude for the peak is 23° 36′ 40″, while the point
where Lieut. Koss observed his latitude of 23° 35′ 47″, near the
south-west shore of the island, is approximately 40″ south of the
peak, giving the latitude of the peak as 23° 36′ 27″. I found the
latitude of the peak to be 23° 36′ 16″, thus again showing as good
an agreement as could be expected, having regard to the fact that
it is not easy to scale the latitude of the point much within 10″
from the existing charts.</p>

<p>At Halaib Fort, the Admiralty latitude is 22° 14′ 10″, while the
“Pola” expedition found it 22° 13′ 26″, and my triangulation
gave<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span> the value 22°
13′ 25″. The close agreement between my triangulation value and
that observed by Lieut. Koss seems to prove the Admiralty latitude
of this point to be some 45″ too high.</p>

<p>Summarizing the latitudes of the three points for comparison we
have:—</p>

<p>If we make corresponding comparisons of the longitudes of these
three points, Berenice Temple, St. John’s Peak, and Halaib Fort, we
obtain much more wide divergences, as is only to be expected from
the fact that the Admiralty and “Pola” determinations were made by
transport of chronometers from Suez, which is over 500 miles
distant from Halaib.</p>

<p>For Berenice Temple the Admiralty longitude (obtained by
applying the scaled reduction of − 40″ to the observed longitude
35° 29′ 11″ at the observation point) is 35° 28′ 31″. Lieut. Koss’s
transport of chronometers from Suez <em>via</em> Jidda leads to a
longitude of 33° 30′ 20″ for his observation point, which lies 54″
east of the temple; thus the “Pola” longitude for the temple is 35°
29′ 26″. My triangulation gives 35° 28′ 26″, thus agreeing very
nearly with the Admiralty value and differing by exactly 1′ from
the value found by Lieut. Koss.</p>

<p>For St. John’s Peak, the longitude scaled from the Admiralty
Chart is 36° 10′ 20″. The observations of Lieut. Koss lead to a
longitude of 36° 12′ 38″ for his observation point, which is about
35″ west of the peak; thus the “Pola” longitude for the peak is 36°
13′ 13″. My triangulation gives 36° 11′ 42″, being thus between the
Admiralty and “Pola” values.</p>

<p>For Halaib Fort, the Admiralty longitude is 36° 37′ 3″, while
Lieut. Koss’s figures lead to the value 36° 40′ 38″; my
triangulation gives 36° 38′ 56″, thus again showing a value between
the two marine determinations.</p>

<p>There can, of course, be no doubt of the immensely greater
accuracy of the triangulation method of determining longitude as
compared with that of chronometer transport in voyages lasting for
months, no matter how many chronometers are carried nor what care
is taken in the work. The above differences of longitude are small
when one considers that no absolute control of the chronometer of
the “Pola” expedition was obtained from October 23, 1895, when the
ship left Suez, till its return to the same port on January 27,
1896. If we examine the difference of longitude between points
fairly close together, we find rather better agreement between
chronometers and triangulation. Thus, for instance, between
Berenice and Halaib, a six days’ voyage, we have:—</p>

<h3>Detail Surveying along Lines of March.</h3>

<p>All detail visible along lines of march from camp to camp was
recorded on plane-table sheets on a scale of 1:100,000. The usual
process was as follows: The plane-table sheet was first provided
with a graticule at 10′ intervals of latitude and longitude, and
all the triangulation points previously fixed within the area
covered by the sheet were marked in their computed places. Stations
were chosen along the route at an average distance apart of two or
three kilometres, the most commanding hills being selected, and the
positions of these were found by plane-table re-section from three
or more triangulation points. The compass, being frequently
disturbed by magnetic rocks,<a id="FNanchor_76"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> was only used to get a
first approximation to the true orientation of the table. The
plane-table station having been fixed on the map, tacheometric
readings were taken to all conspicuous points easy of access within
a radius of about two kilometres, and plotted at their measured
distances along the directions given by the alidade.</p>

<p>In the telemetric measurements a 5-inch tacheometer was used
side by side with the plane-table, and two staff-men were employed.
As the scale of the map was small, the sights were much longer than
is usual in tacheometry, and the maximum distance of 800 metres
directly readable by the four-metre staves employed was generally
exceeded. For the long distance readings, where the distance
between two cross-wires subtended more than the length of the
staff, I devised<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span> the
following process. Bringing the centre wire to the base of the
staff, a reading of the vertical circle was taken; next, by the
tangent-screw, the wire was brought to the top of the staff, and a
second reading of the vertical circle was taken, the difference
giving the angle subtended by the four-metre staff. It is clear
that the distance is as many times greater than 800 metres, as the
angle subtended is less than 17′ of arc, and the distance is thus
found by simple proportion.</p>

<p>In the case of very long sights, even this method failed,
because the circle could only be read to half-minutes, which was
too coarse a graduation to give a good result, and in these cases
the method used was one of repetition. The wire being brought to
the base of the staff as before, and a first reading of the
vertical circle taken, the wire was brought to the top of the staff
by the tangent screw, then to the bottom again by altering the
levelling screws slightly, again to the top by the tangent screw,
and so on, three or four times, and then a second reading was taken
on the vertical circle. The slight alteration of level had no
sensible influence on the result, and it is obvious that by
automatically summing up, say, four intercepts in this way, a very
much more accurate value of the subtense angle was obtained than
was possible from a single measurement. In practice I found it was
best to carry in the waistcoat pocket a card giving the distance
corresponding to any number of minutes of difference of reading
after a four-fold repetition, and it was quite practicable to
measure up to three kilometres of distance within one hundred
metres of the truth; as this only represented a millimetre on the
sheet, and as, moreover, errors were not cumulative, owing to the
independent fixation of each successive station by re-section, the
accuracy was all that could be desired, and the rapidity of
measurement was very great. In this long distance type of
tacheometry, finely graduated staves were of no use; the form of
staff employed was a broad-faced one, fifteen centimetres wide,
bearing fifty-centimetre divisions painted alternately black and
white right across the whole breadth of the staff.<a id=
"FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77" class=
"fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

<p>An average of about six or eight conspicuous points having been
telemetrically fixed from a station, the detail was sketched in
around<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span> them, and
other more distant points were at the same time fixed by
plane-table intersections from several stations. At the stations
the pencil sketching of relief was by form-lines which were
subsequently replaced by hachure-rendering when inking up the
sheets in camp.</p>

<p>Occasionally, when a high hill-station was employed overlooking
a long wadi, time was saved by reading only two distances, both in
the same wadi, one very near to the station and the other two or
three kilometres away, at the same time observing the
depression-angles to these points. The slope of the wadi being
found in this way, the depression-angles to intermediate points
gave the distances of such points without the necessity of staff
reading at the intermediate points at all. Thus, suppose the near
point was close under the station, with a distance of 500 metres
and a depression-angle of 18°, while the remote point up the wadi
had a distance of three kilometres and a depression-angle of 2°
30′. By means of a slide rule or three-figure logarithms, the near
point was found to be 163 metres below the station, and the distant
one 130 metres. A point in the wadi estimated roughly as half way
between the two would be about 146 metres below the station; so
that if the observed depression-angle to it was, say, 4° 40′, its
distance would be <span class="fraction"><span class=
"numerator">146</span><span class="denominator"><em>tan</em> 4°
40′</span></span>, or 1·8 kilometres. Any possible error of
preliminary estimation of the distance in order to find the level
would be without sensible influence on the resulting true
distance.</p>

<p>The process of traversing between stations was seldom resorted
to, as the method of fixing stations by re-section from
triangulation points is much more accurate (the errors not being
cumulative) besides being more rapid. But in certain tortuous
cañon-like wadis, where great and time-consuming climbs would have
had to be undertaken in order to see any triangulation points, the
method of traversing with the tacheometer had to be employed.</p>

<p>Levels along the line of march were measured trigonometrically
whenever possible; the vertical angles to one or more triangulation
points being read with the tacheometer, and the distances scaled
off the map, the differences of height, corrected for refraction,
were found by the slide rule in the same manner as in the
triangulation already described. Heights of passes and camps whence
no triangulation points were visible were determined by
barometer-comparisons between them and points of precisely
determined altitude.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>Names of places
were written down by the guides in Arabic characters on the spot
where they were ascertained, and transliterated on the Egyptian
Government system for insertion in the map. Most of the place-names
were checked by getting the guides to give them from several
different stations.</p>

<h3>Detail Surveying at Occupied Triangulation Stations.</h3>

<p>It was generally necessary to remain for at least a week on the
mountain summits which formed the main triangulation stations, for
only on about one day in seven was the air clear enough for
sighting the beacons on the longer lines. Occasionally the entire
landscape was blotted out for ten or more consecutive days by
clouds surrounding the summit, while at other times it was possible
to see only for a limited distance round the station owing to haze.
Such times were made use of to map all visible detail within a
moderate range (say within a radius of twelve kilometres) round the
station.</p>

<p>In this work the first stage was to find a small base, one end
of which was the station itself. Usually a minor peak of the same
range, 500 to 1,000 metres away from the station, was fairly easily
accessible, and was chosen for the other end of the base. The
six-inch theodolite being at the main station, the five-inch
tacheometer was set up at the auxiliary station, and all noteworthy
hill tops, as well as a few points along each main line of
drainage, were triangulated off this small base. The length of the
base was found by including one or two main triangulation points in
the round of angles. These minor triangles were conveniently
reduced by the slide rule, and the points plotted at once on the
plane-table by means of the alidade and the calculated distances.
The base being short, it was necessary to observe to fine marks;
cracks in the rocks, and the droppings of birds on the peaks, and
the centres of selected tree trunks in the wadis, were usually
chosen. The levels of these minor points were determined by
vertical angulation in the ordinary way. Usually about thirty
points were thus fixed round each high station. Once a number of
points were fixed in the wadis, the levels of these gave the slope,
and the difference of height between any other parts of the wadis
and the station could be estimated to within a few metres by means
of the knowledge thus obtained. A sketch being now made of the
wadis, which appeared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
spread out almost like a map below the station, a hundred or more
points along them were selected, and their depths below the station
being very approximately known from the wadi slope, their distances
were found by observing depression angles to them and reducing the
vertical triangle by means of the slide rule on the spot. In all,
therefore, measurements were usually made of the distances of from
100 to 200 conspicuous points in the area round the station, and
when these were plotted with the alidade on the plane-table sheet
it was not difficult to sketch in all the detail with considerable
accuracy. Usually it was not possible to see all round the mountain
from the station itself, so that subsidiary plane-table stations
near the main one were necessary. In other cases more than one
small base was measured in order to get good angles to various
points by the minor triangulation.</p>

<p>By the combined use of minor triangulation for peaks, and
vertical angulation for points situated along drainage lines, it
was found that far more sketching could be done in a few days at a
main station than would have been possible in the same time by
tacheometric work on the lower ground, and that of greater
accuracy. More than half of the entire detail sketching was in fact
done at the main stations.</p>

<h3>Survey of the Coast-line.</h3>

<p>In the earlier portion of the work, <em>i.e.</em>, north of
latitude 24°, the work on the coast-line was confined to the
fixation of prominent points such as spurs and tips of islands.
Some of these were fixed as intersected points during the
triangulation, while others were determined by observing the
depression angle and azimuth to them from trigonometrical stations
of known altitude. In this latter method, taking the mean
coefficient of refraction as 0·13, the formula<a id=
"FNanchor_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>
employed was</p>

<div class="linegrp-container">
<div class="linegrp">
<div class="line"><em>d</em> = 35·497 (θ − √<span class=
"overline2">&nbsp;θ<sup>2</sup> − 11621
<em>h</em>&nbsp;</span>)</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="nind">where <em>d</em> = distance in metres, θ =
depression angle in seconds, and <em>h</em> = altitude of station
in metres. This formula is rather tedious to work out, though the
work is relatively not so great if a number<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_73">[73]</span> of points are to be calculated from
observations at the same station. Prominent points having been
fixed in this way, the coast-line north of 24° was sketched in from
the Admiralty Chart, adjusting the longitude to fit the points
fixed.</p>

<p>It was sometimes a little difficult, however, to identify the
fixed points on the existing charts, and hence I tried to find some
process of surveying the entire remaining coast-line <em>de
novo</em> in detail. Traversing along the coast was placed out of
question by the great expenditure of time and money which it would
have entailed. Eventually I was led to devise a new method, by
which long stretches of coast-line could be mapped by polar
co-ordinates from mountain stations with great speed and accuracy.
The directions of a series of points sufficiently close together
along the coast were taken by theodolite, and the depression angles
simultaneously observed with the vertical circle. Then, instead of
computing the distances to the points, they were plotted by a
special scale graduated directly in angles of dip; by thus doing
away with all calculation at the station, it was possible to lay
down the points on the chart as fast as the observations could be
taken, usually at the rate of four or five points a minute, and it
was frequently possible to map thirty kilometres or more of
coast-line in an hour with great accuracy. As I have given a full
account of this new method in a separate publication,<a id=
"FNanchor_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>
I shall not go into it further here, but would refer those
interested to the publication just mentioned.</p>

<p>With the aid of the new method the entire coast-line from just
north of Ras Benas southwards to the parallel of 22°, a distance of
over 200 miles, was mapped in detail on the 100,000 scale. I had
frequent opportunities of testing the accuracy of the delineation
of the coast, both by mapping the same stretch from two
widely-distant stations of different heights, and by subsequently
surveying small portions of the coast directly by plane-table and
tacheometer from triangulation points on or near the coast; and in
all cases I found the accuracy to be very high, the differences
found rarely exceeding the thickness of a line on the map. The
tides in the Red Sea are so small in range (generally only about a
metre) that variations of sea-level were practically negligible
during the operations. Bearing in<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_74">[74]</span> mind the great difficulties attending the
survey of so inhospitable a coast by the ordinary method of
traversing, I believe the resulting outline of the coast on my maps
is very much more correct than that shown on any previous charts.
An accurate delineation of the coast-line in this region is of
course chiefly of value as indicating the extent of land; it is of
little importance to the navigator, for whom the positions of the
outlying dangerous reefs, mapped by the Admiralty surveyors, are
far more important.</p>

<h3>Location of the Administrative Boundary between Egypt and the
Sudan.</h3>

<p>By an Arrêté of the Ministry of Interior issued in 1902 it was
enacted that the boundary between the administrative divisions of
Egypt and the Sudan should be as follows:—</p>

<p class="less space-above15 space-below15">Commencing at Bir
Shalatein on the coast of the Red Sea, the limit runs to Bir
Meneiga, thence to Gebel Niqrub, thence to Gebel Um el Tiur and to
Deiga. From Deiga the line continues to Bir Esmet Omar, thence to
Gebel Bartazuga, and finally to the Nile at Korosko.</p>

<p>This frontier was defined after a commission had sat, at the
Mudiria of Aswân, to make enquiries as to the vested rights of the
Bedouin tribes, the guiding principle being that all Bisharin
tribes should be under Sudan administration, and all Ababda tribes
(with one exception) under the Government of Egypt. A map
accompanied the decision, but was of a very rough character, and
the positions of the points specified were not known within several
miles.</p>

<p>Part of my work comprised the precise fixation of the points
specified in the Arrêté, with a view to laying down the boundary
accurately on a map. As was natural in the case of a boundary
settled without careful reference to the ground, certain
difficulties arose in the location. In the first place, there are
two distinct Gebels Niqrub, and two distinct Gebels Um el Tiur. I
assumed the higher mountain of each pair to be the one indicated.
Secondly, the precise point of the mountain was unspecified; I
assumed the highest peak to be the point referred to. Thirdly, the
text of the Arrêté disagrees with the map accompanying it, in that
the map shows the line curved to pass close to Gebel Mishbih, which
is not mentioned in the Arrêté. I assumed the text of the order to
be determinative, and that between<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_75">[75]</span> the points specified the limit followed great
circles on the globe, <em>i.e.</em>, practically straight lines on
the map. The locality called Deiga was not visited, and can only be
approximately fixed; it is said by guides to be a narrow road near
Gebel Muqsim, of which mountain several peaks were fixed by
triangulation.</p>

<p>The following table gives the positions found for the various
points along the boundary from the sea to the meridian of 34° (1)
from my survey operations, and (2) as scaled from the map
accompanying the Ministerial Arrêté. A comparison of the two sets
of positions will show how much the survey has added to our
knowledge of the geography of this part of the desert.</p>

<h3>Variation of the Compass.</h3>

<p>Careful observations were made of the variation of the compass
at three stations, <em>viz.</em>, Berenice Temple, Abu Saafa
Springs, and near Halaib Fort,<a id="FNanchor_80"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> these three points being
selected as being well-known places and at the same time likely to
be free from local magnetic disturbance. Berenice is on the
coast-plain where only coral and sand occur; Abu Saafa is in a
sandstone district about 100 kilometres south-west of Berenice, and
Halaib is on the calcareous and gypseous rocks of the coast about
220 kilometres south-east of Abu Saafa.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>The instrument
used was a five-inch theodolite fitted with a good trough compass.
A lens was used to bring the needle accurately to zero, and the sun
or a star was employed to find the true meridian. In each case
several observations, each with an independent setting of the
needle, were made, and the mean taken. The values obtained
were:—</p>

<p>In order to find to what degree of accuracy the results of these
determinations might be relied on, the instrument used was tested
against the Kew magnetometer at the Khedivial Observatory, Helwân,
after the completion of the work. Three observations for the
declination at Helwân gave the westerly variation as</p>

<p class="nind">while the true declination as given by the Kew
magnetometer at the same time was 2° 52′ 5″. Thus it appears
reasonable to believe the observed values to be within about 5′ of
the truth.</p>

<p>It is rather curious to note that the declination observed at
Abu Saafa is less than that at Berenice, which lies further east,
even if allowance is made for the secular change in the interval.
The difference from what one would expect is, however, possibly
owing to errors of observation of the magnitude above-mentioned, or
it may be due to a slight local influence of magnetic rocks
underground at Abu Saafa, where the ground is near to the base of
the Nubian sandstone beds, which rest presumably on eruptive and
metamorphic rocks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>It is interesting
to compare the observations of declination at Berenice and Halaib
with those recorded by <span class="sc">Rossler</span><a id=

<p>We thus arrive at a yearly secular diminution of declination of
6′ 3″, confirming the value arrived at by Mr. <span class=
"sc">Keeling</span><a id="FNanchor_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82"
class="fnanchor">[82]</a> for the rate of secular change in the Red
Sea area from a comparison of other observations. It may be
therefore concluded that the rate of 3′ per annum given in the
“Admiralty Pilot”<a id="FNanchor_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83"
class="fnanchor">[83]</a> is only about half the true value.</p>

<p>Travellers in the Eastern Desert should exercise care in the
reliance they place on compass bearings. Bearings taken with a
compass are generally normal in granite and sandstone country; but
wherever dark igneous and metamorphic rocks abound, disturbances
are likely to occur. Local deviations of 5° to 10° are quite
common, and in some serpentine areas even 40° of disturbance may be
observed. In some places, one can deflect the needle through a
large angle by means of a fragment of the rock no larger than a
nut, so rich are some of the basic rocks in magnetic minerals. Some
lumps of rock even show strong polarity, attracting or repelling
the north pole of the needle according as one part or another of
the lump is presented to it.</p>

Heshenib is some 250 metres higher than that to the north of it,
the plumb-line will be deflected to the south by local attraction,
thus explaining why the observed latitude at that station exceeds
by so much the value calculated from the triangulation. Berenice
temple, on the other hand, is on a coast-plain remote from
mountains, and the observed latitude agrees closely with the
calculated one.</p>

undertaken of the entire series of reciprocal observations made
during the three seasons’ work shows that <em>k</em> varies
according to the altitude of the lines and according as the lines
pass over land or sea. I hope later to publish a separate account
of this discussion, which has an important bearing on the vertical
distribution of temperature in the air. But I may here state that
for overland lines the formula <em>k</em> = 0·1503 + 0·0000164
(<em>h</em> − 830), where <em>h</em> is the mean altitude of the
line in metres, gives a good agreement with the observations; while
on oversea lines at altitudes above 100 metres <em>k</em> is always
very near to 0·135. The errors in the resulting altitudes of
intersected points due to the uniform employment of <em>k</em> =
0·13, are very trifling, and will seldom exceed one or two metres;
for example, at a distance of thirty kilometres the substitution of
<em>k</em> = 0·16 for <em>k</em> = 0·13 will only change the
altitude by two metres.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>Most of the
drainage-lines mentioned in the description will be found marked on
the orographical map which forms <a href="#pl01">Plate I;</a> but
the scale of that map is too small for all the minor feeders to be
indicated with clearness.</p>

<p class="space-above15"><a id="c04s1"></a><span class="bold">Wadi
Shait</span>, an important main trunk wadi draining westwards to
the Nile, originates at the west foot of Gebel Ras Shait, in lat.
24° 50′, long. 34° 31′, and joins the Nile Valley a little to the
north of Kom Ombo. It has a total length of very nearly 200
kilometres, and an average fall of three metres per kilometre. The
fall is much more rapid in the upper reaches than lower down; in
the first fifty-five kilometres of its length, from the foot of
Gebel Ras Shait to Bir Um Gubur, the fall is 340 metres, or an
average gradient of six metres per kilometre, while from Bir Um
Gubur, for the remaining 140 kilometres of its course, its fall is
only 250 metres, or an average gradient of less than two metres per
kilometre.</p>

<p>The head of Wadi Shait is formed by the union of a number of
drainage channels from a kind of <em>cul-de-sac</em> formed by
Gebels Migif, Ras Shait, and Mudergeg, where it is separated from
the heads of Wadi Gerf and Wadi Hafafit by flat sandy divides.
Passing in a south-westerly direction to the west of Gebel Migif
and Gebel Dweig, it receives as a tributary <span class="bold">Wadi
Dweig</span> (in which are the ruins of an ancient station) on the
left. Taking thence a more westerly course it traverses more open
country, and then narrows among hills north-west of the remarkable
peak of Gebel Abu Khrug. At a bend further on is <span class=
"bold">Bir Murra</span>, a shallow well sunk in the alluvium of the
wadi floor at the foot of a serpentine scarp; the water here (as
the name of the well indicates) is very bitter, and is generally
drunk only by camels. After passing Bir Murra, the wadi turns
south-west, then curves again near <span class="bold">Bir Um
Gubur</span>, about three kilometres south-east of Gebel Sufra, and
about twelve kilometres below Bir Murra. Bir Um Gubur is a shaft
about two and a half metres diameter, sunk about eight metres deep
in the alluvium of the wadi; it was yielding good supplies of
excellent water in 1906. About ten kilometres below Bir Um Gubur,
<span class="bold">Wadi Hamish</span> joins Wadi Shait from the
north-east. In the remainder of the course of Wadi Shait to the
Nile, the principal water source is <span class="bold">Bir
Heliwat</span>,<a id="FNanchor_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84"
class="fnanchor">[84]</a> about ten kilometres below
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span> point of influx
of Wadi Hamish, and the chief tributary wadis are Muelih, Beza, and
Midrik, all of which join it from the north-east.</p>

<p>The upper portions of Wadi Shait contain a fair abundance of
trees and scrub, but the lower parts are sandy arid wastes.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Wadi Muelih</span> originates in the mountain
called Gebel Iteima, in lat. 25° 8′. For about sixteen kilometres
its course lies ill-defined over a sandy plain with scattered low
hills, to Erf el Fahid, a remarkable east and west quartz ridge
nearly two kilometres long rising among crushed diorites and
schists to a height of 579 metres above sea, or ninety-five metres
above the wadi, in lat. 25° 0′. After passing Erf el Fahid, the
course of the wadi changes to south-west, and gradually becomes
more enclosed by low hills. The first hills passed on the right are
high ridges formed by great quartz veins striking south-west, at
the foot of which the wadi forms a plain nearly a kilometre broad,
with low hills and mounds of dark gneisses and schists on the left.
At ten kilometres below Erf el Fahid, on the left of the wadi, is a
horse-shoe shaped hill of aplite called Marwot Rod el Ligaia, to
the north and south of which are other hills penetrated by networks
of quartz veins. Two kilometres further on, a band of diorite
gneiss cuts across the wadi, which then commences to narrow in
among hills of crushed diorites, grey gneisses, and schists, with
many dykes of porphyrite and felsite. These hills become
progressively higher as one descends, and near the meridian of 34°
the wadi curves round the foot of Gebel Muelih, a great bare white
granite boss rising through darker rocks to a height of 330 metres
above the wadi, or 707 metres above sea. Just after passing Gebel
Muelih the wadi, which has here a width of only some 200 metres,
turns south-west again. At this turn, nearly in the centre of the
wadi floor, is <span class="bold">Bir Muelih</span>, an excavation
about six metres deep in the alluvium, yielding very salt water
drinkable only by camels. North-east of the well a track strikes
over the hills towards Dungash mine. From Bir Muelih the wadi
continues in a roughly south-west direction past Bir Samut (well
about one kilometre north of Wadi Muelih) and then takes a more
southerly course draining into Wadi Shait in longitude 33° 46′.</p>

<p>The wadi floor falls from a level of 484 metres near Erf el
Fahid to 375 metres at Bir Muelih, the length of the wadi between
the two places being about twenty-seven kilometres; this gives an
average fall of about four metres per kilometre; the actual
gradient varies from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
about two metres per kilometre in the broader portions to over six
metres per kilometre in the more enclosed parts of the wadi.</p>

<p>The upper parts of Wadi Muelih are barren and sandy, but the
lower portions contain a fair amount of vegetation. The principal
feeders of Wadi Muelih are Wadi Gerf, which enters by several
openings on the left above Gebel Muelih, Wadi Samut, entering on
the right in long. 33° 54′, and Wadi Sibrit, entering on the left
in long. 33° 50′.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Wadi Gerf</span> is the collective name given
to a number of rather complicated drainage channels forming
tributaries to Wadi Muelih. The principal heads are to the east and
west of Gebel Nugrus. The eastern head is called <span class=
"bold">Wadi Hangalia</span>; it commences at about an altitude of
811 metres due east of the highest point of Gebel Nugrus, at a
difficult pass leading over the main watershed to Wadi el Nom, and
curves round the north spurs of Gebel Nugrus to join the western
head. In the Wadi Hangalia are some old ruins of a mining camp, and
also some recent prospecting workings and a well giving a poor
supply of water. The Western head of Wadi Gerf commences in nearly
level ground on the main divide west of Gebel Nugrus, at an
altitude of 691 metres. These two main heads unite close to the
east of Gebel Ras Shait, whence Wadi Gerf courses about north-west
through low hills. A third head is in lat. 24° 52′, at a pass
leading into Wadi Um Khariga. A fourth, called <span class=
"bold">Rod el Atut</span>, takes the drainage from all sides of the
conspicuous black cone of Gebel Atut. A fifth, called <span class=
"bold">Rod Um el Farag</span>, drains from the mass of moderately
high hills further west called Um el Huetat; these hills contain
some old mines, chiefly in talc schists. The drainages from these
various heads all eventually take a west-south-west course among
low hills and over a sandy plain and enter Wadi Muelih by several
openings near longitude 34°. Minor tributaries are <span class=
"bold">Wadi Abu Seyal</span> and <span class="bold">Wadi Um
Seyal</span>, south-east of Gebel Atut, <span class="bold">Rod el
Ligaia</span>, in longitude 34° 10′; and <span class="bold">Rod el
Ligah</span>, in latitude 24° 50′.</p>

<p>The principal hills of the plain over which Wadi Gerf and its
tributaries run their course are some very remarkable small black
peaks collectively called Khusa el Faraon, a light coloured hill
called Marwot Rod el Ligah, and a ridge called Erf el Sagur; these
two last rise to 514 and 523 metres above sea-level
respectively.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>Wadi Gerf
possesses a fair amount of vegetation, except where it meanders
over the sandy plains; in the tributaries Wadi Um Seyal and Wadi
Abu Seyal acacia trees are specially numerous.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Wadi Sibrit</span> is a long narrow wadi
following a course somewhat south of west, originating to the west
of Gebel Mudergeg and joining Wadi Muelih in longitude 33° 50′. It
possesses many trees and a good well, <span class="bold">Bir
Sibrit</span>. This latter is an excavation in the wadi floor, in
longitude 33° 58′; it is said to yield a constant supply. In the
spring of 1906 I found the water was at a depth of eight metres
below the surface, and of good quality.</p>

<p class="space-above15"><a id="c04s2"></a><span class="bold">Wadi
Kharit</span>, one of the greatest trunk wadis of Egypt, has its
principal head at Gebel Ras el Kharit, on the main watershed in
latitude 14° 10′ and longitude 35°. Pursuing a course the
prevailing direction of which is a little north of west, and
collecting the drainage from numerous great wadis on its way, it
debouches on the Kom Ombo plain and reaches the Nile at the same
point as another great wadi, Shait, in latitude 24° 35′. The length
of the main channel is over 260 kilometres, and of its tributaries
probably more than twenty times as great. It drains an area of more
than 23,000 square kilometres. Its average fall is about two metres
per kilometre, but in its lower reaches its gradient is less than
half this amount.</p>

<p>The principal tributaries of Wadi Kharit, which will be
separately described, are the Wadis Natash, Antar, Khashab, Abu
Hamamid, Elemikan, and Garara (this last with Wadis Timsah and
Ghadrib as great feeders). I now propose to trace out the course of
the main wadi in some detail, leaving its greater tributaries for
separate description, but including its minor feeders.</p>

<p>The main head of Wadi Kharit is on the Nile-Red Sea divide,
between Gebel Ras el Kharit and Gebel Mikbi, at an altitude of
considerably more than 600 metres above the sea. The wadi at first
courses a little south of west, over a gently falling sandy plain
with hills of bouldery granite, and curves round the south spurs of
Gebel el Anbat.<a id="FNanchor_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85"
class="fnanchor">[85]</a> Here it receives two tributaries, one
from the north-west called Wadi Hilgit, and one from the south-east
called Wadi Egat.<a id="FNanchor_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86"
class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span><span class=
"bold">Wadi Hilgit</span> originates on the main watershed in
longitude 34° 52′, near Gebel Um Usher. A very steep and difficult
pass over the watershed separates its head from that of another
Wadi Hilgit draining northward to Wadi Huluz. The two wadis are
called Wadi Hilgit lil Kharit and Wadi Hilgit lil Huluz
respectively when it is necessary to distinguish them. On its
course southward to Kharit, Wadi Hilgit receives as tributaries
<span class="bold">Wadi Um Hasidok</span> and <span class=
"bold">Wadi Um el Tiur</span>, draining the mountains of the same
names.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Wadi Egat</span> drains part of the west
slopes of Gebel Abu Gurdi and the south part of Gebel Egat, for the
first half of its course being shut in by high hills and for the
latter half passing over a gently falling plain.</p>

<p>After passing Gebel el Anbat, Wadi Kharit continues its course a
little south of west, in broad shallow drainage channels over a
great sandy plain. In this part of its course it receives many
important feeders from the mountain masses which limit the plain to
the north. The principal of these feeders are the <span class=
"bold">Wadis Anbat</span>, <span class="bold">Abarun</span>,
<span class="bold">Um Daba</span>, <span class="bold">Abu
Argub</span>, <span class="bold">Safihat</span>, <span class=
"bold">Um Sellim</span>, and <span class="bold">Medsus</span>. Near
where Wadi Medsus enters, Wadi Kharit takes a more southerly
course, passing north of a mass of low dark hills called Gebel
Geneina, and here it receives <span class="bold">Wadi Abu
Gurdi</span>, draining the west slopes of the mountain of the same
name, the ill-defined Wadi Elemikan (<em>see</em> <a href=
"#Page_84" class="pginternal">p. 84</a>), draining the extensive
plain south of Gebel Abu Gurdi, and the <span class="bold">Rod el
Geneina</span>, draining from the hills of Geneina. A little
further on, curving to the north-west, it receives <span class=
"bold">Wadi Abu Hashim</span> and <span class="bold">Wadi Abu
Selili</span>, which drain the south flanks of Gebel Kahfa.</p>

<p>The next feeder is the <span class="bold">Wadi Helie</span>,
which drains the west slopes of Gebel Kahfa and enters Kharit from
the north-east; a well, <span class="bold">Bir Helie</span>, exists
in this wadi about eight kilometres above its junction with Kharit.
The well appears to be of the same character as Bir Abu Hamamid; it
was yielding plenty of good water in the spring of 1906, but in the
autumn of the same year the supply was said to be smaller and
rather salty.</p>

<p>About ten kilometres below the point of influx of Wadi Helie,
Wadi Kharit receives Wadi Abu Hamamid (<em>see</em> <a href=
"#Page_85" class="pginternal">p. 85</a>), coming from the
north-east, and some fourteen kilometres further on another
tributary, the <span class="bold">Rod el Kharuf</span>, enters from
the opposite side conveying the drainage from the north-west flanks
of Gebel Zergat Naam.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>In the remaining
portion of its course to the Nile, Wadi Kharit receives numerous
other tributaries, of which the principal are Wadi Khashab and Wadi
Antar on the north, and the Wadi Garara on the south (<em>see</em>
<a href="#Page_86" class="pginternal">pp. 86</a> and <a href=
"#Page_87" class="pginternal">87</a>).</p>

<p>On the whole, Wadi Kharit is poor in vegetation; trees are
fairly abundant in the central portion of its course, but both near
its head and near the river it is very barren. In consequence of
its sandy and arid character near the Nile, it is not usual for
caravans to journey along the wadi from its mouth; Arabs from Daraw
usually go up the tortuous and sandy Wadi Allawi, and thence enter
Kharit either by the Rod Abu Modellim or by a track among hills
which leads eastward to <span class="bold">Bir Qoleib</span>. Bir
Qoleib is a good well in a small tributary of Wadi Kharit, about
seventy kilometres by road from the Daraw. From Bir Qoleib to the
wells of Abu Hamamid and Helie the westward journey is about 110
kilometres, while from Bir Qoleib to the well of Abu Hashim,
south-east (on the road to Abu Saafa), is a distance of about
seventy-five kilometres.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Wadi Elemikan</span> is the name given to an
ill-defined system of drainage channels meandering over the plain
south of Gebel Abu Gurdi. It originates on the main watershed, and
at its head there is a very easy pass over into the Wadi Lahami,
which descends to the sea. At this point, which is 590 metres above
the sea, the watershed is ill-defined, being a sandy plain; but
while to the west the plain continues with only a slight fall, to
the east it soon gives place to rugged country through which narrow
wadis descend rapidly towards the sea coast. The plain west of the
watershed is remarkable for the presence of three great bosses of
quartz, the largest of which, called Marwot Elemikan, rises as a
conspicuous cone of dazzling whiteness to a height of sixty-eight
metres above the plain. Besides the drainage from the plain itself,
Wadi Elemikan receives feeders from the hills which flank Gebel Abu
Gurdi to the south, and also a portion of the drainage from the
Wadi Abu Gurdi, which divides into two channels on emerging from
the mountains. Passing between the granite hills of Gebel Abu
Derega and Gebel Selaia, Wadi Elemikan courses a little north of
westward over a great sandy plain to join the Wadi Kharit north of
Gebel Geneina in longitude 34° 36′. It is a barren wadi, but water
can sometimes be obtained a little north of it at a small spring
called <span class="bold">Megal el Selaia</span>, at the foot of a
low hill one kilometre south-east of the great<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_85">[85]</span> rounded granite boss of Gebel Selaia. I
obtained a small supply of very good water here early in 1906, but
the spring is a very slow one and is said to fail altogether in dry
seasons.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Wadi Abu Hamamid</span>, an important
tributary of Wadi Kharit, originates as a series of gullies in the
mountains of Gebel Abu Hamamid, on the west face of the main
watershed, in longitude 34° 48′. It courses, among high hills a
little north of west to longitude 34° 41′, then turns south-west
and enters the plain which extends to the west of Bir Shadli. Here
it receives part of the drainage from Wadi el Sheikh, and turns
westward among lower hills, passing north of the red hills called
El Hamra, to Bir Abu Hamamid, and then turning south-west between
El Hamra and Hamrat Mukbud to join Kharit in longitude 34° 23′.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Bir Abu Hamamid</span> is an important well;
it is a rude irregular excavation, about six metres deep, in the
wadi floor, down which men can walk to fill their water skins. This
well was yielding more plentiful supplies in the autumn of 1906
than any of the other wells in the neighbourhood; the water was
rather salty and muddy, but quite drinkable.</p>

<p>From near Bir Abu Hamamid, a track leads north-westward over the
hills to Bir Khashab and on to Bir Masur. To reach Bir Shadli, one
follows up the Wadi Abu Hamamid till it opens on to a plain, and
then strikes almost due eastward across the plain.</p>

<p>A small tributary which joins Wadi Abu Hamamid from the
north-east, in longitude 34° 41′, called <span class="bold">Wadi
Marasani</span>, is important as leading to a pass over the main
watershed into Wadi Marasan, a tributary of Wadi Huluz. The
altitude of the pass is 685 metres above sea; it is quite
practicable for baggage camels.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Wadi el Sheikh</span>, the only great
tributary of Wadi Abu Hamamid, originates in longitude 34° 40′, in
the hilly tract west of Gebel Abu Hamamid. In the upper part of its
course, it is a narrow winding wadi, mostly shut in by high hills,
pursuing mainly a direction a little west of south, fed by numerous
lateral wadis entering from among the hills to the east, of which
the principal are the <span class="bold">Wadis Um Somra</span>,
<span class="bold">Krioni</span>, <span class="bold">Um
Nasir</span>, <span class="bold">Um Hereini</span>, <span class=
"bold">Um Sereiha</span>, <span class="bold">Um Deheisi</span>,
<span class="bold">Um Retba</span>, and <span class="bold">Um
Hargal</span>. Near the point where Wadi Um Deheisi joins it, the
Wadi el Sheikh emerges from the hill country and meanders over a
plain. At its entry on to the plain is the tomb and well of
<span class="bold">Sheikh<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_86">[86]</span> Shadli</span>, views of which are given on
<a href="#pl05">Plate V.</a> The tomb, from which the wadi derives
its name, is a white domed structure, tended by a Moorish guardian.
The Ababda Arabs hold the memory of Sheikh Shadli in high
veneration, and make yearly pilgrimages to his tomb. The well,
<span class="bold">Bir Shadli</span>, close to the tomb, is a
shallow excavation in the stony alluvium of the wadi floor. Here
there is a perennial supply of water, which, however, varies much
in quality and quantity; after rain, there forms a large pool of
good water, the surface being maintained almost level with the
ground by underground influx; while when there has been no rain for
a year or more the water is only found by digging to several metres
depth, and then only infiltrates slowly at the bottom of the hole,
the quality simultaneously falls off and the water acquires a
saline and purgative character.</p>

<p>After passing Bir Shadli and entering on the plain, Wadi el
Sheikh splits up into numerous channels, one of which joins the
Wadi Abu Hamamid, while the others continue in a south-westerly
direction, fed by the Wadis Um Retba and Um Hargal, draining from
the north flanks of Gebel Kahfa. Uniting together as they leave the
plain to re-form a single Wadi el Sheikh, these drainages turn
westward among the hills to join the Wadi Abu Hamamid.</p>

<p>Bir Shadli is one of the best-known centres of the Ababda Arabs.
Though there is no permanent settlement, it is seldom that many
days elapse without Arabs coming to the place to water their
animals, which graze in the adjoining wadis. Many roads converge
here. To the west, a track leads to Bir Abu Hamamid. To the
north-east, a track leads up the Wadi Sheikh, across Wadi Abu
Hamamid, and by an easy pass near Gebel Marasan over the main
watershed into Wadi Huluz. To the south-east there are several
alternative routes by which one can journey over easy passes north
of Gebel Kahfa on to the plain of Selaia and down the Wadi Lahami
to Berenice. Yet another road leads a little west of south across
the Wadi Um Hargal, and by an easy pass into Wadi Helie, a small
tributary of Wadi Kharit which drains the west side of Gebel Kahfa,
and in which there is a well of similar character to that of Abu
Hamamid.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Wadi Khashab</span> commences its course near
Gebel el Heda, a little east of longitude 34° 30′, and continues in
a generally south-west direction to the latitude of Gebel Hamrat
Mukbud. Here it takes a westerly course, passing south of Gebel
Homr Akarim and entering<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_87">[87]</span> Wadi Kharit from the north in about longitude
33° 49′. Wadi Khashab receives its name from its relatively
well-wooded character; in its upper parts it presents the
appearance of a broad valley, in which trees are so numerous as to
give a very pleasing contrast to the dreary wastes on either side
of it. <span class="bold">Bir Khashab</span> is a series of pits
sunk in the wadi floor in about longitude 34° 23′, which were
yielding small supplies of water in 1906.</p>

<p>The principal feeders of Wadi Khashab are Wadi Metawit and Wadi
Antar. <span class="bold">Wadi Metawit</span> is a short valley
originating near Gebel Metawit, and joining Wadi Khashab a short
distance above Bir Khashab. It possesses an important well,
<span class="bold">Bir Metawit</span>, excavated about eight metres
deep in the centre of the wadi floor, about three kilometres
north-north-west of the summit of Gebel Metawit, on a road leading
south-east from Bir Masur to Bir Shadli. This well, near which are
some large acacia trees, was yielding a plentiful supply of
excellent water in the spring of 1906.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Wadi Antar</span> originates near the hills
of Nukheira and El Heda, and courses westward as a very wide
shallow sandy depression south of Gebel Um Goraf. At the foot of
Gebel Derera it turns southward, receiving the tributary Wadi el
Anz from the left a little further on; it turns again westward and
then north-west to near Gebel Muktil, beyond which it courses
south-west and joins Wadi Khashab in longitude 33° 55′, a short
distance only above the point where that wadi enters Kharit.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Wadi el Garara</span>, the great southern
tributary of Wadi Kharit, heads on the main watershed east of Gebel
Um Harba. Pursuing at first a north-westerly course over a sandy
plain, it emerges between two high sandstone hills ten kilometres
north of Gebel Um Harba, and turns somewhat more to the west,
receiving the <span class="bold">Wadi el Kreim</span>, which drains
the south-east flanks of Gebel Zergat Naam. A little further on it
receives an unnamed tributary which courses north-westward from
Gebel Um Harba as a great valley nearly full of blown sand. Still
further on its course it is fed by another unnamed tributary which,
coming from the main watershed in latitude 23° 30′, courses over a
wide sandy plain north-westwards. This latter tributary is very
barren, but is of some importance as forming a very easy though
sandy road over the main watershed to the Wadi Arned (which leads
to the springs of Abu Saafa) and as passing, about five kilometres
before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span> reaching the
pass, a well known water-hole called <span class="bold">Galt el
Aguz</span>. This galt is a huge sandstone basin in the hills on
the east side of the road, fairly easy of access. After rain it
holds an immense supply of water, but owing to the porous nature of
the sandstone it becomes dry in a few months of drought; rude Greek
inscriptions on the rocks, mixed with spirited drawings of animals,
show that this source of water supply was known and used in
Ptolemaic days. Besides the drainage from the pass, the tributary
first mentioned takes that from the sandstone hills of Um Khafur
situated further east.</p>

<p>A little lower down, Wadi Garara receives feeders from the
north-east, draining the hills round Gebel Nikeiba and Gebel
Felieiti, and then the long Wadi Timsah coming from the south.</p>

<p>Wadi Timsah heads among high granite hills a little north of
latitude 23°, and courses in a nearly northerly direction for
nearly ninety kilometres to join Wadi Garara. The prevailing
character of Wadi Timsah itself is sandy and dreary, but its
feeders from the eastern hills are richer in vegetation, and in
years when there is rain they furnish in their upper portions good
grazing ground for Arab camels. The principal of these feeders,
enumerating from the south northwards, are the <span class=
"bold">Wadis Um el Rid</span>, <span class="bold">Awamtib</span>
(with Wadi <span class="bold">Um Marakh</span>), <span class=
"bold">Shabakhit</span>, and <span class="bold">Dagalai</span>. All
these drain the western parts of the high sandstone hills called by
the same names. Water can be got from galts here after rain. Near
the head of Wadi Um el Rid, there is a very easy pass over the main
watershed into Wadi el Dreb, which leads to the well of Um
Reit.</p>

<p>Of the <span class="bold">Wadi Ghadrib</span>, which heads near
the hills of Gebel Abu Rahia and Gebel Um Rewat, in latitude 23°,
and follows a course roughly parallel to, but a few kilometres west
of that of Wadi Timsah, not very much is known. Its prevailing
character is sandy and arid.</p>

<p>The small tributary called <span class="bold">Wadi Abu
Hashim</span>, which enters Wadi Garara from the south in about
longitude 34° 5′, is important as containing the important wells
known as <span class="bold">Bir Abu Hashim</span>. The wells are
excavations in the alluvium of the wadi floor, and furnish good
water at a depth of about eight metres. A beacon has been erected
on a high hill to the west of the wells and overlooking them, the
position of which is latitude 23° 41′ 44″ N., longitude 34° 3′ 33″
E., altitude 386 metres above sea and sixty-six metres above the
wells. The principal roads from Bir Abu Hashim are, to Aswân (first
water at Um Hibal,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
nearly one hundred kilometres distant), to Daraw (first water at
Bir Qoleib, seventy-five kilometres distant), and to Abu Saafa
Springs (a journey of about one hundred kilometres with possibly
water en route at the Galt el Aguz, sixty kilometres from Abu
Hashim).</p>

<p><span class="bold">Wadi Natash</span> commences among the low
hills forming the Nile — Red Sea watershed between Gebel Migif and
Gebel Abu Had. It pursues a course roughly parallel with that of
Wadi Shait, at first over a sandy plain from which rise the two
conspicuous cones called El Nahud (the breasts), and afterwards
narrowing in among hills. Pursuing a somewhat devious course in a
direction generally a little south of west, Wadi Natash passes
south of Gebel Nugra (in longitude 33° 40′) and enters on the great
plain called Atmur Nugra, where it joins the Wadi Kharit and drains
to the Nile near Kom Ombo.</p>

<p>There is, I believe, no water source in Wadi Natash itself, but
<span class="bold">Bir Masur</span> is situated in a branch wadi
only a few kilometres north of it in longitude 34°. At Bir Masur
there are numerous pits sunk in the alluvium of the wadi, in one or
more of which good water can generally be found at a depth of about
ten metres; but the supply cannot always be relied on, for although
I obtained plenty of water in March 1906, I found there was only a
very small quantity available in October of the same year.</p>

<p class="space-above15"><a id="c04s3"></a><span class="bold">Wadi
Alaqi</span>, the greatest of all the Egyptian wadis draining
westwards to the Nile, has its head on the main watershed near
Gebel Is, close to the 22nd parallel in longitude 35° 27′. Its main
channel, over 350 kilometres in length, pursues a general westerly
course, winding at first, past the old mining centres of Darahib
and Alfawi, towards Gebel Muqsim, on the 34th meridian, and then,
curving round to the north of that mountain, it turns to the
north-west, past the gold mines of Um Gariart, and enters the Nile
Valley opposite the large village of Dakka, in latitude 23° 8′. The
area of its basin is unknown, much of it being unexplored, but it
probably comprises no less than four square degrees of the earth’s
surface, or 44,000 square kilometres. Its heads and upper
tributaries lie among high mountainous tracts partly in Egypt and
partly in the Sudan, and occasionally the rainfall in these
southern parts of the eastern desert is sufficient to convert the
usually dry wadi into a temporary stream for a part or all of its
length. That it may on the rare occasions of sufficient<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span> rainfall discharge no
inconsiderable quantity of water into the Nile is proved by
Linant’s experience about 1830, when he records that the torrent
from the Wadi Alaqi into the Nile was so great as to prevent his
<em>dahabîa</em> sailing up the river past the point of influx,
even with a good wind and all sails set.<a id=
"FNanchor_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>
A great flow of water down the Wadi Alaqi also occurred in the
autumn of 1902 as a consequence of heavy rains in the mountainous
country east of the meridian 34° 30′. This torrent was observed by
Mr. John F. Wells, who was then manager of the Um Gariart mine. In
the early morning news was brought to the mine that great waters
were coming down the wadi. Except for a slight rainfall at the
heads of the Wadis Qoleib and Haimur, the drainage of which did not
appreciably swell the flood of the main wadi, there had been no
rain within one hundred kilometres of the mine, and when the alarm
was given, at 6.30 a.m., only a small trickling of water down the
wadi was visible, and the news was thought to be an exaggeration.
But an hour later the whole wadi was a raging torrent, and by nine
o’clock there was a mighty stream, over 300 metres wide and from
one to two and a half metres deep, rushing past the mine. The flow
continued for about two and a half days. On this occasion the
stream, in spite of its magnitude at Um Gariart, did not reach the
Nile; after flowing for some seventy kilometres past the mines, it
entered a wide depression at Hagab Kara, some forty kilometres from
the mouth of the wadi, where it formed a great pool and sank into
the sand. Mr. Wells informs me that the water did not penetrate the
sandy and gravelly floor of the wadi to the bed rock (the thickness
of the sandy and gravelly layer at Um Gariart is fourteen metres)
till three months later, and then the rock, though damp, did not
absorb enough water to yield any supply to wells sunk in it. The
local Arabs stated that these downrushes of water, which they term
“seil,” occur on an average at about ten-year intervals; the last
one occurred seven years before that of 1902.</p>

<p>The part of the basin of Wadi Alaqi falling within the limits of
the district described in this volume includes the whole country
west of the main watershed between the parallels of 22° and 23°.
This area is drained by numerous tributaries of Alaqi, all entering
the main wadi from its north side. The following is a brief
description of these tributaries, commencing with the uppermost
(easternmost) of them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span><span class=
"bold">Wadi Himeitra</span> is a small wadi draining the south face
of Gebel Himeitra. It contains a well, <span class="bold">Bir
Himeitra</span>, at the foot of the mountain, which is said to
yield constant supplies of water. Below the well, Wadi Himeitra
continues for about ten kilometres in a south-westerly direction,
joining the Wadi Alaqi about seven kilometres above the ruins of
Darahib.</p>

<p>The <span class="bold">Miti Kwan</span>, the next tributary of
Alaqi, has its heads in the north flanks of Gebel Himeitra. Near
its head it receives as feeders from the north-east the
<span class="bold">Wadis Kirir</span> and <span class=
"bold">Duag</span>, draining mountains of the same name which form
part of the Adar Qaqa range. About fourteen kilometres further down
its course, the Miti Kwan receives the <span class="bold">Wadi
Merau</span>, which drains the hills of the main watershed round
Eir Arib. Below the point of influx of Merau, the Miti Kwan pursues
a very winding course among the hills for some eleven kilometres,
then receives from the north the <span class="bold">Wadi
Miaus</span>, a small wadi with many branches among the hills and
containing a well, <span class="bold">Bir Miaus</span>, about seven
kilometres up from its mouth. After receiving Wadi Miaus, the Miti
Kwan continues a winding course for about nine kilometres and
enters the Wadi Alaqi on the 22nd parallel, about fifteen
kilometres below the ruins of Darahib. A well-known road,
connecting the Wadi Alaqi with the Abu Hodeid and Meisah wells,
leads up the Miti Kwan for a distance of some twenty-three
kilometres, and then passes northwards over a stony plain, crossing
the watershed into the head of Wadi Hasium, in which is Bir
Kagog.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Wadi Dageina</span> is a small many-branched
tributary of Alaqi, draining the hills east of Gebel Egat.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Wadi Alfawi</span>, which enters Wadi Alaqi a
little lower down its course, is likewise a small wadi draining the
hilly tract east of Gebel Egat; there are some old mines on its
western side close to its junction with Wadi Alaqi.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Wadi Egat</span>, the next important
tributary of Alaqi, drains by very numerous branches the remarkable
peak of Gebel Egat and the south faces of Gebel Heleikonti. It
contains a well, <span class="bold">Bir Egat</span>, situated
east-south-east of the peak, about twenty-six kilometres up from
its junction with Alaqi, and there are extensive remains of old
mining operations to be seen in the same neighbourhood. Passing
east and south of Gebel Egat, the wadi emerges from the mountains,
coursing almost due west; and after receiving various feeders, the
principal of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span> which is
<span class="bold">Wadi Hiteib</span>, from the mountains to the
north, it enters Wadi Alaqi in longitude 34° 40′, about twenty
kilometres west of Gebel Egat.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Wadi Hateib</span>,<a id=
"FNanchor_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>
which enters Wadi Alaqi about twenty kilometres below Wadi Egat,
has its heads in the south faces of Gebel Um el Tiur el Foqani and
the north flanks of Gebel el Hateib or Suhin. Coursing generally
south-westward, it receives small feeders on the west from Gebels
Adraq and Guqub. About four kilometres above where it enters Wadi
Alaqi, Wadi Hateib is joined from the east by <span class=
"bold">Wadi Suhin</span>, the heads of which drain the south faces
of Gebel Hateib or Suhin.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Wadi Guqub</span>, a very small wadi which
enters Alaqi six kilometres lower down than Hateib, drains the
hilly tract which here lies to the north of Alaqi; it contains an
important well, <span class="bold">Bir Guqub</span>, which yields
good water though in varying quantity. A road leads from Wadi Alaqi
up the Wadi Guqub past the well and on to Aswân, <em>via</em> El
Haimur.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Wadi Um Teneideb</span> drains the western
faces of Gebels el Adraq and Guqub, and joins Wadi Alaqi in
longitude 34° 11′, about thirty-three kilometres below Wadi Gugub.
It has two main branches, which unite about ten kilometres above
the point of junction with Wadi Alaqi. The old mines of Betam are
situated near the northern of the two branches, about seven
kilometres west of Gebel el Adraq, on the road just mentioned as
leading from Wadi Alaqi to Aswân.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Wadi Defeit</span>, which is probably the
most important Egyptian tributary of Wadi Alaqi, has its heads in
Gebels Heleikontî and Heianai, about the meridian of 35°. Its
general course is that of a flat circular arc convex to the north
and having its chord east and west; the total length of its main
channel, from its head in Gebel Heleikontî to its junction with
Wadi Alaqi in longitude 34° 10′, is over one hundred kilometres,
while its numerous tributaries probably reach a total length three
times as great. The principal head of Wadi Defeit is called
<span class="bold">Wadi Sarid</span>; its branches extend among the
hills close to the heads of Wadi Egat and Wadi Miaus. The name
Defeit is applied to the wadi<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_93">[93]</span> where Wadi Sarid is joined by the feeders
from Gebel Heleikontî. Passing between the high ranges of Heianai
on the north, and Heleikontî and Shanaiyet on the south, Wadi
Defeit receives numerous feeders, of which the principal are the
<span class="bold">Wadis Dauriai</span> and <span class=
"bold">Hamidâ</span>, both entering it from the mountain to the
south; continuing westwards, it cuts through the north end of the
mass of Gebel Um el Tiur el Foqani, and on emergence is joined by
the <span class="bold">Wadi Bint el Feqoh</span>, a great
westward-coursing tributary draining the north flanks of the
Heianai range and the more northerly mountain of Anweyib.
Continuing its westward course, Wadi Defeit passes between Gebels
Um el Tiur el Tahtani and Adraq; then it enters on an extensive
tract of more open country, receiving three main feeders,
<span class="bold">Wadi Meladoyeb</span>, <span class="bold">Rod
Hauanin</span>, and <span class="bold">Wadi Bagharid</span>, from
the hills to the north, before joining Wadi Alaqi.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Wadi Seiga</span>, the next great northern
tributary of Wadi Alaqi, has only been partially explored. Its head
is in the watershed range near the conspicuous twin peaks of Gebel
Sheyenit. Pursuing at first a southerly course, it cuts through the
east side of the mass of Gebel Seiga; and about thirty kilometres
lower down passes through hills with old gold mines on either hand.
Below the mines, Wadi Seiga takes a south-westerly course, and
receives a large tributary from either side. That from the west,
called <span class="bold">Wadi Deheis</span>, heads in Gebel Deheis
and curves round east of Gebel Abu Brush, receiving in its course
two great feeders, the <span class="bold">Wadis Um Gholqa</span>
and <span class="bold">Abu Had</span>, both of which head far to
the north in the main watershed. The eastern tributary, called
<span class="bold">Wadi Um Derera</span>, drains the south part of
the hill-mass in which the Seiga mines are situated. Wadi Seiga
joins Wadi Alaqi in longitude 33° 53′, some forty-five kilometres
below the mines; the junction is outside the limits of the maps in
this volume.</p>

<p class="sch">THE WADIS DRAINING EASTWARDS TO THE SEA.</p>

<hr class="decor spaced2 width4">

<p class="space-above2">The eastward drainage differs strikingly
from the westward in being much steeper and more complex, due to
the greater proximity of the mountains to the sea than to the Nile.
While all the westward drainages form parts of but three great
basins, there are on the seaward side no less than forty-seven
distinct drainage basins, each having a separate outlet to sea
(<em>see</em> <a href="#pl02">Plate II</a>). Only two of the
eastern basins, Hodein and Di-it, are comparable in size with the
great basins of the west, the remainder being relatively small.</p>

<p>The following list gives the names in order, from north to
south, of the main wadis draining to the sea, with their
tributaries so far as they fall within the area treated of in this
volume, the principal feeders of the tributaries being indicated in
parentheses. It may be remarked that the minor feeders and
tributaries are frequently of greater importance to the Arabs than
the main channels, owing to their containing vegetation in greater
abundance.</p>

<p class="space-above15"><a id="c05s01"></a><span class="bold">Wadi
Dabur</span> falls only partly within the district to be described
in the present volume. It drains the hill country between Gebels
Atut and Igli, by numerous feeders, and courses north-east to enter
the sea about latitude 25° 16′, beyond the limits shown on the
map.</p>

<p><a id="c05s02"></a><span class="bold">Wadi Igli</span> is a
short wadi draining from Gebel Igli and coursing a little north of
east to the sea somewhat south of latitude 25° 10′.</p>

<p><a id="c05s03"></a><span class="bold">Wadi Um Khariga</span> has
its principal head in a <em>cul-de-sac</em> west of Gebel Ghuel and
north of Gebel Hangalia, at an altitude of approximately 800 metres
above sea-level. Near its head there is an easy pass entering from
the west, forming a line of communication with Hangalia mine; the
highest point of the pass is 773 metres above sea-level. After
coursing for about twelve kilometres a little west of north between
the high hills called Gebel Um Khariga, with a rapid fall, the wadi
turns north-east, receiving just below the bend a large tributary
which heads in an easy pass to Wadi Ghadir. Near this place a road
crosses the wadi northwards through the low hills, and passes west
of Gebel Igli el Iswid; it is said to go on to Qena. Further on in
its course towards the sea, Wadi Um Khariga receives another
tributary draining the south flanks of Gebel Igli el Iswid. The
lower portion of Wadi Um Khariga has not been surveyed in detail;
but it passes through a tract of lower hills and enters the sea in
about latitude 25° 5′. The total length of the main channel of Wadi
Um Khariga is about fifty kilometres, and the area of its basin is
about 300 square kilometres.</p>

<p><a id="c05s04"></a><span class="bold">Wadi Sukari</span>, the
next wadi to the south, heads at a pass from Wadi Ghadir; for about
nine kilometres it courses east of north between the eastern range
of Gebel Um Khariga and the craggy Gebel Sukari,<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span> then turns more to the east and
enters the sea a little south of Wadi Um Khariga. Near the south
end of Gebel Sukari there are numerous ruins and some ancient gold
mines.</p>

<p><a id="c05s05"></a><span class="bold">Wadi Um Tundeba</span>
heads near the mountain of the same name, and courses about
north-east to the sea. In one of the heads of this wadi, about
three kilometres west of the summit of Gebel Um Tundeba, is an
important water source, called <span class="bold">Galt Um
Tundeba</span>. This is a rock basin situated about one kilometre
up a little wadi; it contained a good supply of water in December
1905, but as it depends for its supply on rainfall in the
surrounding hills, it cannot be relied on as a permanent water
source.</p>

<p><a id="c05s06"></a><span class="bold">Wadi Amba-ut</span> is a
small wadi originating near the granite hills called Gebel Amba-ut,
and following a course about parallel with the Wadi Um Tundeba
seawards.</p>

<p><a id="c05s07"></a><span class="bold">Wadi Ghadir</span>, which
drains by numerous tributaries the eastern face of Gebels Hangalia
and Zabara, as well as the hilly country round Gebels Ghadir,
Allawi, and Lewewi, has a basin of over 500 square kilometres and a
length along its main channel, not counting its feeders, of about
forty-five kilometres; it enters the sea in latitude 24° 50′.</p>

<p>The principal head of Wadi Ghadir is at an easy pass between
Gebels Ghuel and Um Khariga, in latitude 24° 55′, at an altitude of
about 500 metres above sea-level. Coursing south-east, it receives
important feeders from gorges in the west face of Gebel Ghuel; the
principal of these feeders, <span class="bold">Wadi Ghuel</span>,
contains water holes, which gave an excellent supply of rain water
in 1905-06. A little further along its course, Wadi Ghadir passes
the low hill district called <span class="bold">Kurdeman</span>,
where there are some old gold mines, and then receives as
tributaries <span class="bold">Wadi Fegas</span> and <span class=
"bold">Wadi Ma-ud</span>, draining the mountains of Ghuel and
Hangalia. Taking now a more easterly direction towards Gebel
Ghadir, it receives from the north-west <span class="bold">Wadi
Sabahia</span>, draining the craggy felsite hill of the same name;
there are some old gold mines about a kilometre north-east of this
hill, in a branch of Wadi Sabahia.</p>

<p>The <span class="bold">Wadi Zabara</span>, an important
tributary draining the north flanks of Gebel Zabara and the
south-east part of Gebel Hangalia, enters Ghadir from the
south-west, nearly opposite Wadi Sabahia. Wadi Zabara has itself
three main heads, called by the separate names of <span class=
"bold">Wadi Atabi</span>, <span class="bold">Wadi Um Abid</span>,
and <span class="bold">Wadi Um Dafiri</span>. There are ruins and
ancient mines close to where the Wadi Atabi joins Wadi<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span> Zabara, while in the upper
part of Wadi Um Dafiri are more extensive ruins and numerous
ancient emerald mines, as well as a series of rock basins which
were yielding good water in 1905-1906.</p>

<p>After receiving the Wadi Zabara, Wadi Ghadir continues its
course south-east past Gebel Ghadir, from the slopes of which
numerous small feeders enter the main channel. Almost due south of
Gebel Ghadir, in the southern one of two branches into which the
wadi splits as it passes round a low island-like mass of hills, is
<span class="bold">Bir Ghadir</span>, a well sunk in the alluvium
of the wadi floor. When I visited it early in 1906 this well was
filled by downwash, and the Arabs of the district deferred digging
it out until the rock basins were empty; it is an important water
source and is said to yield good supplies. The mines of Hangalia
were supplied by water from Bir Ghadir in 1905, when nearer sources
were dry.</p>

<p>About six kilometres below the well, Wadi Ghadir passes close
north of Gebel Allawi, where there are some old gold mines. The
<span class="bold">Wadi Allawi</span>, which with its tributary
<span class="bold">Wadi Lewewi</span> drains the hilly country
between Gebels Zabara and Sikait, enters Ghadir a little to the
east of Gebel Allawi; both Allawi and Lewewi are very tortuous
wadis, their names in fact meaning “crooked” in the Ababda tongue
(Lewewi is a diminutive of Allawi).</p>

<p><a id="c05s08"></a><span class="bold">Wadi Um Gamil</span>, the
next wadi entering the sea to the south, drains the hilly country
south-east of Sikait. Very little is known about its course, the
only part surveyed being the heads east of Gebel Sikait.</p>

<p><a id="c05s09"></a><span class="bold">Wadi Gemal</span> is the
terminal portion, about sixty kilometres in length, of the main
drainage channel from a basin nearly 200 square kilometres in area.
With its numerous large feeders, the principal of which is Wadi
Huluz, about eighty kilometres in length, the Wadi Gemal drains the
Hafafit and Nugrus ranges of mountains on the north, and a great
mass of high mountains, including Gebel Hamata, on the south. It
will be convenient here to describe only the Wadi Gemal proper,
leaving the great wadis which join to form it, and its major
tributaries, for separate treatment.</p>

<p>The name Wadi Gemal is first given to the drainage at the point
where Wadi Huluz turns sharply eastward in longitude 34° 39′.<a id=
"FNanchor_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89" class=
"fnanchor">[89]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
At this point the country becomes more open than in the gorge-like
Wadi Huluz. To the north is a mass of low granite hills, some of
which have remarkable shapes, with a great deal of drift sand,
while to the south are the higher dark hills flanking Gebel Um
Suerab. Among these surroundings the wadi pursues a winding course,
with a general north-easterly direction, receiving the Wadi Um
Suerab lil Gemal and the Wadi Durunkat as tributaries from the
south.</p>

<p>About six kilometres below the point of influx of Wadi Durunkat,
on the right (south) side of Wadi Gemal, is a locality called
<span class="bold">Geli</span>, where there are extensive ruins. A
very remarkable rock in the middle of the main wadi marks the place
whence a track leads south-east past the ruins and across the heads
of Wadis Um Ghazal and Mukhatatat into the upper part of Wadi el
Abiad.</p>

<p>Passing a remarkable bell-shaped hill (Gebel Um Regeba, rising
to 571 metres above sea, the “mosque rock” of Floyer’s map) about
four kilometres on the left, Wadi Gemal receives two small feeders
coming from among the hills to the south, and then the important
tributary called Wadi Hafafit enters from the north-west.</p>

<p>Below the point of influx of Hafafit, the Wadi Gemal becomes
more narrow, and shut in by high hills. Near the meridian of 34°
49′ there are some ruins on the north side of the wadi, and a
little further on the Wadi Nugrus, one of the largest tributaries
of Wadi Gemal, enters from the north-west at a rather sharp bend.
Further down, Wadi Gemal receives <span class="bold">Wadi el
Mukhatatat</span> and <span class="bold">Wadi Um Sueh</span> from
the south, and <span class="bold">Wadi Um Heran</span> and
<span class="bold">Wadi el Nasbia</span> from the north. The Wadi
Abiad, which next joins Wadi Gemal from the south, is an important
feeder. Two kilometres below the mouth of Wadi el Abiad, the
<span class="bold">Wadi Um Kabu</span> enters Wadi Gemal from the
north-west, while nearly opposite to it is a small wadi, called
<span class="bold">Um Sellimi</span>, in which there are water
pools after rain. The wadi now curves more northward round the base
of the double-topped hill mass called Madaret Um Gamil. Just beyond
the northward turn a road<a id="FNanchor_90"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> leads up a narrow tortuous
gully in a north-westerly direction, passing close south of the
hill summit and forming the most ready means of ascent of Madaret
Um Gamil; the climb from the road at the top of the gully is only
about 200 metres. The course of the Wadi Gemal to the
sea<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span> has not been
surveyed beyond four kilometres east of Madaret Um Gamil; it goes
through low hilly country and enters the sea in about latitude
24°.</p>

<p>The fall of the Wadi Gemal averages about six metres per
kilometre, being as low as four metres per kilometre in some
places, and probably exceeding ten metres per kilometre where it
emerges from the hills on to the coast-plain. It is interesting to
note that the observations of level indicate a local increase of
gradient above the place of influx of Hafafit and Nugrus. The Wadi
Gemal is well supplied with trees, as are also almost all its
tributaries with the exception of the sandy Wadi Hafafit.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Wadi Huluz</span> is a long winding wadi,
mostly shut in by high rock walls, draining the high mountains
round Gebel Hamata and coursing north-east for a distance of over
seventy-five kilometres to the point, near Gebel Um Suerab, where,
turning sharply eastward, it enters more open country and takes the
name of Wadi Gemal. The slope of Wadi Huluz averages fifty metres
per kilometre for the first ten kilometres from its heads in the
mountains. In the next ten kilometres the slope is much flatter,
being twenty metres per kilometre. From twenty to forty kilometres
from its head the average fall is only ten metres per kilometre,
while still further down the rate of fall lessens till in the last
reaches, just before entering the Wadi Gemal, it is only six and a
half metres per kilometre.</p>

<p>The principal heads of Wadi Huluz are close to the south-east of
Gebel Hamata, in a <em>cul-de-sac</em> formed by the high mountains
of Gebel Hamata (1,978 metres above sea) and Gebel Ras el Kharit
(1,661 metres). Here a number of steep gorges unite to form the
main channel, which due south of Hamata has an altitude of 1,053
metres above sea-level. Following a winding course among the
mountains as a rapidly falling valley with a sandy floor averaging
100 metres or more in width, it passes west of the great mass of
Hamata, receiving the drainages from the north-east flanks of that
mountain and from the north face of Gebel Um Hasidok. At its
crossing the meridian of 35° it receives as a feeder the
<span class="bold">Wadi el Abiad lil Huluz</span>, which drains the
north face of Hamata and the south flanks of Gebel Abu Ghusun;
draining mostly from granite country, this feeder has a floor of
coarse granitic sand, from the whitish colour of which it takes its
name.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>The next feeder
of Wadi Huluz, called <span class="bold">Wadi Mahali</span>, enters
from the south, its head being on the main watershed between Gebels
Um Usher and Um Hasidok. Passing between Gebels Um Usher and Um
Laham, the Wadi Huluz receives <span class="bold">Wadi
Tarfawi</span>, draining the mountain of the same name from the
east. Further down, feeders come in from Gebel el Mehali on the
south and from the high hills south of Gebel Um Heshenib on the
north. Near the meridian of 34° 50′ two important tributaries enter
Huluz near together from the south. The upper one, <span class=
"bold">Wadi Hilgit lil Huluz</span>, heads in a very steep and
difficult pass, leading into Wadi Hilgit lil Kharit. The lower one,
called <span class="bold">Wadi Um Semiuki</span>, drains the
north-east flanks of Gebel Abu Hamamid. Nearly opposite the mouth
of Wadi Um Semiuki is another feeder of Wadi Huluz, which I believe
forms the main drainage channel for the south face of Gebel Um
Heshenib; but it is said to be very steep and stony, and my Arabs
preferred to reach Gebel Um Heshenib by a small wadi, containing
several tombs, some four kilometres higher up Wadi Huluz, whence
there is a stony pass leading into the above-mentioned main
drainage channel at a point above the obstructions in it.</p>

<p>About eight kilometres further on, on the north-east side of the
wadi, there is a low gap over which by a very easy pass one can
descend into the head of Wadi Durunkat, leading to Wadi Gemal. Some
three kilometres lower down, Huluz receives two tributaries
together; one, from the south-east, is called <span class=
"bold">Wadi Um Hegiligi lil Huluz</span>, while the other, from the
south-west, is called <span class="bold">Wadi Marasan</span> and
heads in an easy pass on the main watershed, over which a track
leads south-east and south to the well and tomb of Sheikh
Shadli.</p>

<p>Two sheikhs’ tombs and some smaller graves exist at a bend in
the Wadi Huluz, three kilometres below the point of influx of Wadi
Marasan. Below these enter as feeders <span class="bold">Wadi Um
Suerab lil Huluz</span> from the north, and <span class="bold">Wadi
Abu Gerifat</span> from the south. The wadi now becomes very
tortuous. Near the meridian of 34° 40′, on the south side of the
wadi, at a bend where trees are very abundant, is a small gully
containing the important water holes called <span class="bold">Um
Gerifat</span>. These are rock basins fed by rain water draining
down steep gorges from the hills round the twin-peaked Gebel Um
Sedri; they are easily accessible in a few minutes from the main
wadi, and contained good supplies of water in the winter of
1905-1906. About four kilometres lower down,<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_104">[104]</span> the <span class="bold">Wadi Um
Iteili</span> enters from the east, and about five kilometres
beyond this Huluz opens out into a somewhat triangular space, when
the <span class="bold">Wadi Gaetri</span> enters from the west and
<span class="bold">Wadi el Khisei</span> from the east. The Wadi
Gaetri leads by an important pass into the more open country to the
west (wells of Wadi Khashab and Wadi Natash).</p>

<p>At the open space above-mentioned, Wadi Huluz turns northward,
winding somewhat, for some eight kilometres, and then, after
receiving the <span class="bold">Wadi Abu Etl</span> as a feeder
from the west, turns sharply eastward and becomes the Wadi
Gemal.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Wadi Durunkat</span>, a tributary of Wadi
Gemal, forms an important road from Wadi Gemal into the higher
parts of Huluz. By following it up to its head about twenty
kilometres from its junction with Wadi Gemal, one can enter Wadi
Huluz by a very easy pass in longitude 34° 46′, thus cutting off
the long winding course of Wadi Huluz itself; and from this pass
one can cross the main watershed by the Wadi Marasan to reach Bir
Shadli.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Wadi Hafafit</span>, another tributary of
Wadi Gemal, has its head situated close to the east side of Gebel
Migif, in latitude 24° 50′, on the main watershed, where there is
an easy pass into the head of Wadi Shait. Following a very straight
course for nearly forty kilometres south-east, with the remarkable
range of high gneiss mountains called Gebel Hafafit on the left,
and the sugar loaf granite hills of Abu Had on the right, Wadi
Hafafit forms a broad barren valley in which there are heavy
accumulations of blown sand. <span class="bold">Wadi Abu
Had</span>, a small western feeder of Hafafit, is well known by
reason of the well of bitter water, <span class="bold">Bir Abu
Had</span>, at its head. An eastern feeder of Wadi Hafafit, which
joins it shortly before the junction with Wadi Gemal, is called by
the diminutive name of <span class="bold">Wadi Hefeifit</span>.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Wadi el Abiad</span>, likewise a tributary of
Wadi Gemal, derives its name from the coarse white granitic sand
which forms its floor. Its heads are situated near latitude 24°
20′, among the granite mountains called Gebel el Abiad and on the
northerly slopes of Gebel Um Heshenib. There is a very steep pass
from its head, east of Gebel Um Heshenib, into Wadi Huluz. Pursuing
an almost northerly course and falling rather rapidly, Wadi el
Abiad is at first very wide, with high granite hills on each side.
It narrows further down, at a point opposite Gebel Shoab, where a
small eastern feeder leads by an easy sandy pass into the Wadi
Shoab. A little lower down, passing into diorite<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span> country, it turns more to the
east, and after receiving the <span class="bold">Wadis Um Seyal el
Foqani</span> and <span class="bold">el Tahtani</span> from the
south-east, enters the Wadi Gemal near Madaret Um Gamil. The wadis
called Um Seyal receive their name from the abundance of acacia
trees in them; at the head of Wadi Um Seyal el Foqani there is a
pass leading by the Wadai el Anz into Wadi Um el Abbas.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Wadi Nugrus</span>, an important tributary of
Wadi Gemal, commences its course on the main watershed west of
Gebel Nugrus, in latitude 24° 48′, at the pass into Wadi Gerf, 690
metres above sea-level, and courses south-east in almost a straight
line for nearly forty kilometres to join the Wadi Gemal in latitude
24° 34′ and longitude 34° 50′. The fall to this point is some 450
metres, or an average of over ten metres per kilometre, but the
fall is most rapid near the head, where the floor of the wadi is
rocky and steep; the slope for the first few kilometres is over
double the average.</p>

<p>The approach to the head of Wadi Nugrus from the north, by one
of the heads of Wadi Gerf, is almost a plain. But as soon as Wadi
Nugrus is entered one becomes very sensible of the greater
steepness of the eastern drainage by the stony nature of the track
and the rapid fall. The wadi here is in fact only a narrow gorge
with the huge mountains of Hafafit and Nugrus on the west and east
sides respectively. Some three kilometres below the pass, close to
the west side of the wadi, in a narrow gorge, is the spring called
<span class="bold">Megal el Harami</span>, situated in gneiss
rocks, and giving supplies of good water; the water infiltrates
slowly, however, so that the yield is not sufficiently rapid to
supply large quantities at once. Lower down, the wadi broadens out
considerably, with a sandy floor in the middle of which low dark
hills rise like islands. About thirteen kilometres below the head,
an important feeder, the <span class="bold">Wadai el Nom</span>,
comes in from the north-east. This wadi drains the south-east
flanks of Gebel Nugrus and the west flanks of Gebel Hangalia; it
contains rock basins holding water for some time after rain, and
leads to a steep winding pass which enables one to make a circuit
round the great granite mountain of Gebel Nugrus. The pass is,
however, impracticable for baggage camels, and one has to dismount
from a riding camel in order to get over.</p>

<p>Beyond the junction of Wadai el Nom, the Wadi Nugrus continues
its straight course south-east, between the long range of Gebel
Hafafit on the west and Gebel Zabara on the east. Some thirty
kilometres<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span> below
its head, Wadi Nugrus receives the <span class="bold">Wadi Abu
Rusheid</span> from the north, and a little further on one
encounters on the east the ruins of an old village called
<span class="bold">Medina Nugrus</span>. Just opposite the ruins is
a small feeder called <span class="bold">Wadi Abu Sada</span>, a
short distance up which are rock basins yielding water after rain,
but these were dry in 1905. Not far below this, there are some old
workings in a small feeder on the east side of the Wadi Nugrus, six
kilometres above its junction with Wadi Gemal.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Wadi Sikait</span>, a tributary of Wadi
Nugrus, heads in some high red granite hills north-west of Gebel
Sikait. A pass leads over the western head, while in the eastern
one is a small spring, which, though a mere trickle, is said to be
constant and to yield excellent water. These two heads join at a
well recently sunk by miners. Lower down, on the flanks of Gebel
Sikait, are numerous emerald mines, with an ancient tower and many
other ruins, and in the wadi near these is another recently sunk
well, which has only yielded water of inferior quality. From near
the mines there lead two tracks on either side of the wadi. That to
the west is a rough path over gneiss hills into Wadi Abu Rusheid.
That to the east winds past the ancient tower, ascending gradually
to a pass into one of the heads of Wadi Um Gamil. Lower down the
Wadi Sikait are many ancient mines, and the ruins of three rock
temples and an ancient village. Just before the Wadi Sikait enters
Wadi Nugrus, a track leaves on the east for <span class="bold">Wadi
Um Heran</span>, in which I am told water is sometimes to be found.
The length of the Wadi Sikait is about fourteen kilometres, and its
fall is from 535 metres above sea at the pass at its head to about
250 metres where it enters Wadi Nugrus, or an average slope of
twenty metres per kilometre. It is a narrow gorge shut in by high
hills, with a fair abundance of trees.</p>

<p><a id="c05s10"></a><span class="bold">Wadi Um el Abbas</span>
originates by the union of several heads in the neighbourhood of
the high granite hills of Um el Abbas and Abu Hegilig. One of its
heads leads to an easy pass called <span class="bold">Kab el
Haram</span>, four and a half kilometres east of Gebel Abu Hegilig.
Another, close east of Gebel Abu Hegilig, leads to another easy
pass into the head of a tributary of Wadi Romit. A third head,
called the <span class="bold">Wadai el Anz</span>, leads to yet
another pass into Wadi Um Seyal el Foqani, a tributary of Wadi el
Abiad. The course of the Wadi Um el Abbas has only been surveyed
for a short distance below the place where its heads<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span> unite; it pursues a
north-easterly course among low hilly country and enters the sea in
about latitude 24° 36′.</p>

<p><a id="c05s11"></a><span class="bold">Wadi Abu Ghusun</span>
commences its course among the high mountains of Gebel Abu Ghusun,
north of Gebel Hamata. Pursuing a northerly course for about ten
kilometres, it passes close east of the sharp granite peak of Gebel
Hefeiri, then turns more to the east, receiving Wadi Romit as an
important tributary from the west near the bend, and reaches the
sea in about latitude 24° 29′.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Wadi Romit</span>, a tributary of Abu Ghusun,
originates in the granite mountains called Gebel el Abiad, near the
parallel of 24° 20′ and follows a winding course in a general
easterly direction for about sixteen kilometres to its junction
with Wadi Abu Ghusun. It receives several important tributaries.
The chief of these, <span class="bold">Wadi Shoab</span>,
originates close to the south-west of Gebel Shoab, where there is
an easy pass into the Wadi el Abiad. Another tributary of Romit,
the <span class="bold">Wadi Abu Hegilig</span>, drains the south
part of Gebel Um el Abbas, while a third is the <span class=
"bold">Wadi Hefeiri</span>, draining the hills round the granite
peak of the same name. All these tributaries, like Wadi Romit and
Wadi Abu Ghusun itself, contain abundance of trees, and have a
rather rapid fall.</p>

<p><a id="c05s12"></a><span class="bold">Wadi Hamata</span> drains
the eastern flanks of the high hills north of Gebel Hamata, its
principal heads being about latitude 24° 15′. Only the heads of
this wadi have been surveyed; it follows a winding course among the
lower hill country and reaches the sea in about latitude 24°
24′.</p>

<p><a id="c05sharatr"></a>Of the three wadis draining seawards
south of Hamata, called <span class="bold">Wadi Haratreit</span>,
<span class="bold">Wadi Khashir</span>, and <span class="bold">Wadi
Mikbi</span>, very little is known, not even their heads having
been visible from the stations which I occupied. The summits of the
mountains drained by them have, however, been mapped, and their
courses are approximately known from the accounts of Floyer; these
are indicated on the map probably in nearly their true positions.
Draining mostly steep and precipitous mountain faces, the upper
parts of these wadis must have an extremely rapid fall, and
consequently a rough stony floor.</p>

<p><a id="c05s13"></a><span class="bold">Wadi Lahami</span>, which
enters the sea north of the peninsula of Ras Benas, is well known
by reason of the easy pass over the main watershed at its head
forming an important means of access to Berenice from the west. At
this point, four kilometres north-east of the<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_108">[108]</span> white quartz cone called Marwot
Elemikan, the watershed is sandy, level, and low, being only 590
metres above the sea. The drop on crossing the watershed is fairly
rapid, the wadi winding about among the hills in a general
north-easterly direction. About six kilometres below its head,
Lahami receives the <span class="bold">Wadi Um Karaba</span>, which
drains the south face of Gebel Abu Gurdi. A little further on,
<span class="bold">Wadi Eidab</span> enters from the south-east;
this feeder is said to head in a rough steep pass over the hills
into the Wadi Abu Daba. After passing between the high hills of
Gebels Um Goradi and Um Gunud, Wadi Lahami receives the short
<span class="bold">Wadi Um Gunud</span>, in which there are two
well known galts, or rock basins forming reservoirs of rain water;
these contained good supplies in 1906-7. Lower down, Wadi Lahami
crosses a stony sloping plain, where it receives the drainage from
the north and east flanks of Gebel Abu Gurdi and from the mountains
to the north of it, by a series of feeders, the principal of which
are <span class="bold">Wadi Um Rishan</span>, <span class=
"bold">Wadi Um Homar</span>, and <span class="bold">Wadi
Sefent</span>. East of the plain there is a sort of shunt or
loop-line of Wadi Lahami, called the <span class="bold">Wadi
Abreik</span>, which is preferred to the main channel for a road.
Just receiving Wadi Sefent, Wadi Lahami turns sharply eastward, and
then north-eastward, receiving as feeders <span class="bold">Wadis
Um Khuzama</span>, <span class="bold">Um Ghobasha</span>, and
<span class="bold">Gumudlum</span>, draining Gebels Um Sellim and
Gumudlum to the north; these feeders are said to contain natural
reservoirs full of water after rain. From the south, Lahami is fed
by the <span class="bold">Wadis Um Eshub</span> and <span class=
"bold">Abu Marwa lil Lahami</span>, draining the lower hill
country. The lower course of Wadi Lahami has not been traced in
detail. It passes north-west of the well marked granite peak called
Gebel Um Huk, as remarked above, and reaches the sea north of the
peninsula of Ras Benas. To get to Berenice, one leaves Wadi Lahami
about twenty-four kilometres below the pass at its head, and turns
off south-east up the tributary Wadi Abu Marwa, which leads to Wadi
Naait by an easy road.</p>

<p>Wadi Lahami is well supplied with trees; it presented a very
green appearance early in 1906, but the absence of rain for a year
made it much more desolate looking in 1907, all the foliage being
then blackened and withered. Its length is approximately fifty
kilometres, its average slope twelve metres per kilometre, and the
area of its basin is about 650 square kilometres.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>The drainage
from the low hills on the <span class="bold">Peninsula of Ras
Benas</span>, except for a small portion which joins Wadi Mukhit,
reaches the sea by a multitude of small wadis, none of which bear
special names. The hills being nearer to the south side of the
peninsula than to the north, the wadis draining southwards are on
the whole much shorter and steeper than those draining northwards,
and the latter cross a sloping plain two or three kilometres wide
to reach the sea. Passage across the hills from south to north is
only possible to camels at a few places. The southern wadis are
mostly barren, but the northern ones contain abundance of a dark
coloured grass of which camels are fond. There is no permanent
water source on the peninsula, the nearest reliable source of
supply being a galt in Wadi Mindeit, on the main land, about twelve
kilometres west of Berenice. The tip of the low sandy projection of
Ras Benas is marked by a sheikh’s tomb, one of the largest on the
coast. It is chiefly built of wreckage cast up on the beach. From
the hills it looks like a rectangular rock, and I determined its
position by triangulation as latitude 23° 53′ 50″ N., longitude 35°
47′ 13″ E. The sheikh’s memory appears to be greatly venerated by
sailors, and several of my camel men made pilgrimages to the tomb
to pray.</p>

<p>The <span class="bold">Island of Mukawar</span>, about six
kilometres south of the sandy tip of the ras, is nearly two
kilometres in length from north to south. I did not visit it, but
it has the appearance of being made of coral; its highest point,
near the south end, is thirty-four metres above the sea-level.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Wadi Abu Daba</span> drains the eastern
flanks of Gebel Eidab and Gebel Um Maiat, and courses eastward
through the lower hill country to the coast plain, where it joins
the drainage from Naait in Wadi Mukhit. The principal feeder of Abu
Daba is <span class="bold">Wadi Murra</span> which enters it from
the south-west a few kilometres before its emergence on to the
plain. At the head of Wadi Abu Daba there is said to be a rough
steep pass over the mountains into Wadi Eidab. The place where Abu
Daba debouches on to the coast plain is marked by a group of low
bouldery looking granite hills called Khasheib Abu Daba.</p>

<p><a id="c05s14"></a><span class="bold">Wadi Abu Dibban</span> is
a short wadi draining eastwards from the hills across the coast
plain to the sea a little north of Berenice. In its course across
the plain it passes a little north of a conspicuous granite hill
called Sikeit, a well known landmark five kilometres north-west of
Berenice.</p>

<p><a id="c05s15"></a><span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_110">[110]</span><span class="bold">Wadi Mindeit</span>
drains the hills between Gebel Um Maiat and Gebel Kalalat, entering
the sea at Berenice.<a id="FNanchor_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91"
class="fnanchor">[91]</a> <span class="bold">Wadi Um Sellim lil
Mindeit</span>, a shorter wadi coursing across the plain a little
further south, is interesting as furnishing the nearest fresh water
source to Berenice; it leads to a rock basin or galt among the
hills, where rain water collects. This source is some ten or twelve
kilometres from Berenice.</p>

<p><a id="c05smukhit"></a><span class="bold">Wadi
Naait</span><a id="FNanchor_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92" class=
"fnanchor">[92]</a> is a narrow tortuous gorge, with a sandy floor
shut in by high hills, coursing eastward to the coast plain a
little south of the 24th parallel. Though only a small wadi some
sixteen kilometres in length, it is well known because it forms the
usual road from Wadi Lahami to Berenice. Its actual head has not
been surveyed, but lies probably between the mountains of Um Gunud
and Um Hegilig. Its principal feeders are <span class="bold">Wadis
Um Sumer</span> and <span class="bold">Abu Marwa lil Naait</span>,
which enter it from the north-west, and <span class="bold">Wadi Abu
Ghalqa</span>, entering from the north and draining the granite
hills called Gebel Abu Ghalqa. All three of these feeders enter
Naait near together, some ten kilometres before it emerges on the
plain; the lower part of the wadi is free from lateral branches.
The fall is ten metres per kilometre among the hills. On emerging
from the hills on to the sandy coast plain, it joins an ill-defined
drainage line called <span class="bold">Wadi el Mukhit</span>,
which enters the sea at Port Berenice, some fifteen kilometres
further east. The name Wadi el Mukhit is also given to other
ill-marked drainage lines entering Port Berenice from the sandy
tract between the hills of the main land and the hills of the
peninsula of Ras Benas. Some three kilometres north-east of the
mouth of Wadi Naait, on the coast plain, is a conspicuous isolated
low hill, forming a well-known landmark and called <span class=
"bold">Grain el Rih</span>. The plain drained by Wadi el Mukhit is
a dreary sandy waste, and the crossing of it in a high wind is very
trying by reason of the immense clouds of sand raised and carried
in the air.</p>

<p><a id="c05s16"></a><span class="bold">Wadi Kalalat</span> heads
in the north-west portion of Gebel Kalalat, and courses nearly
eastward to reach the sea in latitude 23° 52′. For the first
two-thirds of its course of about thirty kilometres, Wadi Kalalat
is shut in by high hills, and falls rather rapidly. At its head a
rough steep pass is said to exist into the head of Wadi
Shut.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span> After passing
round the north flank of Gebel Kalalat, the wadi receives two small
tributaries called <span class="bold">Wadi Um Maiat</span> and
<span class="bold">Wadi el Dibag lil Batoga</span>, the former
draining the north-east face of Gebel Kalalat and the latter the
north-west face of Gebel Batoga. After receiving Wadi Dibag, the
Wadi Kalalat makes a bend northward for about two kilometres, then
turns south-eastward to the opening of the hills on the
coast-plain. About two kilometres above the point where it leaves
the hills, on the south side of the main wadi, is a rocky gully
containing the <span class="bold">Galt Batoga</span> a rock basin
which contained good water in 1907 and which is very easy of access
in a few minutes from the main wadi. About one and a half
kilometres further down, the small <span class="bold">Wadi Um
Sellim</span>, draining the north-east parts of Gebel Batoga, joins
the Wadi Kalalat just before it opens on to the coast-plain. The
course of Wadi Kalalat from here to the sea, about eleven
kilometres, is ill-marked, over a sandy plain. A ruined enclosure
of considerable size, called <span class="bold">Garia
Kalalat</span>, lies close south of the wadi about seven kilometres
from the sea.</p>

<p><a id="c05s17"></a><span class="bold">Wadi Um Goran</span> is a
small wadi draining by many heads from the east face of Gebel
Batoga and its foot hills to the sea in latitude 23° 50′.</p>

<p><a id="c05s18"></a><span class="bold">Wadi Kunserob</span>,
draining the south parts of Gebels Kalalat and Batoga, courses at
first nearly southwards, then curves round south of Gebel Dibag,
and after receiving <span class="bold">Wadi Dibag lil
Kunserob</span> from the north-west, proceeds eastward through the
hills and across six kilometres of sandy coast-plain to the sea in
latitude 23° 47′.</p>

<p><a id="c05s19"></a><span class="bold">Wadi Abu Berigâ</span> is
a short drainage line from among the hills to the sea, a little
south of Wadi Kunserob.</p>

<p><a id="c05s20"></a><span class="bold">Wadi Khoda</span> is an
important main drainage channel some forty-five kilometres in
length, coursing a little north of eastward to reach the sea in
latitude 23° 43′. For the greater part of its length it is shut in
by high hills, only the last six kilometres being across the sandy
coast-plain. With a basin approximately 780 square kilometres in
area, it drains the mountains of Abu Dahr, Dahanib, Shut, Reyan,
Shenshef, Hindia, and Um Akra, some of which rise to over 1,000
metres above the sea; it thus receives a fair amount of water in
rainy years, and is well supplied with trees and bushes. Its
average fall is about nine metres per kilometre.</p>

<p>The head of Wadi Khoda is formed by the union of three
wadis,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span> coming
approximately from the north, west, and south, in the form of a
cross. The central one of these, <span class="bold">Wadi Abu Debebi
lil Khoda</span>, heads in a very easy pass leading to Bir Betan
and the old mines of Um Eleiga. The one to the north, <span class=
"bold">Wadi Salib el Abiad</span>, is said to lead into Wadi Khiua,
and to possess some old mines, but has not been explored. The
remaining one of the three, <span class="bold">Wadi Salib el
Azrak</span>, drains the east face of Gebel Abu Dahr and the high
hills east of it; the feeder of it from Abu Dahr, called
<span class="bold">Wadi Um Karaba</span>, leads by an easy pass,
just north of the mountain, to Bir Betan and the Um Eleiga mines,
while some eight kilometres from its junction with Khoda a track
leads up a gully south-westward over another easy pass to Bir
Rahaba. The names Salib el Abiad and Salib el Azrak refer to the
form of the wadis and the nature of their floor, <em>salib</em>
meaning “cross,” while <em>abiad</em> and <em>azrak</em> refer to
the prevailing white and dark colours of the sand in the respective
arms of the cross; these colours are due to the wadis draining
light-coloured granites and dark-coloured serpentines and schists
respectively.</p>

<p>A little below the union of the three arms above-mentioned, Wadi
Khoda expands into a small rather stony plain, where the sinuous
<span class="bold">Wadi Allawi</span><a id=
"FNanchor_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>
enters from the north. This important feeder, which drains the
eastern face of Gebel Dahanib, is mostly shut in by high hills, and
is relatively well wooded; if it be followed up for about ten
kilometres, one comes to the tomb of Sheikh Farhan, near which meet
many small feeders, one of them containing a small rock basin near
its head.</p>

<p>About eight kilometres below the point of entry of Wadi Allawi,
Wadi Khoda receives two feeders from opposite sides; that from the
north, <span class="bold">Wadi Um Tawil lil Khoda</span>, drains
from Gebel Dahanib, while that from the south, <span class=
"bold">Wadi Hindia</span>, is a sandy rapidly-falling wadi draining
Gebel Hindia.</p>

<p>Some five kilometres further down, <span class="bold">Wadi Um
Akra</span>, draining the mountains of the same name, enters Khoda
from the south, while another two kilometres brings us to the place
of influx of <span class="bold">Wadi Shut</span>, an important
feeder from the north. The head of Wadi Shut is on the west side of
Gebel Kalalat, whence its course is westward for about ten
kilometres; it is then joined by the <span class="bold">Wadi Abu
Hugban</span>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
coming from the south-west, and from this point it runs
south-south-east for some twenty-three kilometres to its junction
with Wadi Khoda. Wadi Shut is a rather wide wadi with a sandy
floor, fed by many tributaries from the mountains of Dahanib, Um
Hegilig, Reyan, and Shut. Its principal feeder in the lower part of
its course is <span class="bold">Wadi Um Tawil lil Shut</span>,
which drains the south part of Gebel Dahanib and enters Shut from
the west about five kilometres above its junction with Khoda. The
Wadi Shut has a fair growth of trees, and is said to possess also a
large water source, the exact locality of which has not, however,
been ascertained.<a id="FNanchor_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94"
class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

<p>Just below the place where Wadi Shut joins it, Wadi Khoda
receives a small feeder called <span class="bold">Wadi Um
Gubur</span>, entering from the north and marked by several graves
near its mouth. On the other side, two kilometres further on,
<span class="bold">Wadi Shib</span> enters from the south, and five
kilometres further the <span class="bold">Wadi Um Seyal lil
Khoda</span> enters Khoda from the north.</p>

<p>The <span class="bold">Wadi Gumudlum</span>, the next great
feeder of Khoda, enters from the north four kilometres below Wadi
Um Seyal. It is a wadi some eighteen kilometres in length, coursing
south-south-east, and having its head on the west side of Gebel
Kalalat. A little below wadi Gumudlum, near a boss of white quartz,
several small feeders, of which the two principal are called
<span class="bold">Wadi Buluk</span> and <span class="bold">Wadi Um
Lassaf</span>, enter Wadi Khoda from the south; these drain the
north side of the high hills called Gebel Um Etli.</p>

<p>The last feeder of Wadi Khoda, the <span class="bold">Wadi
Shenshef</span>, enters the main wadi some three kilometres above
the place where it debouches on to the coast-plain, or eight
kilometres from the coast. It is a narrow and very tortuous gorge
winding among high hills. If it be followed up for about ten
kilometres, one comes to several small wells called <span class=
"bold">Bir Shenshef</span>, which contained water in 1907, and a
little above the wells, where the wadi becomes more open, there are
ruins, called <span class="bold">Hitan Shenshef</span>, which
attest the former existence of a town or large village. The ruins
are on both sides of the wadi, and many of them are extremely well
built of slabs of quartz schist; besides<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_114">[114]</span> the houses in the wadi itself, there are
small towers on the hills. As there are apparently no mines in the
hills here, the origin of the ruins is not clear; from the strong
situation and the watch towers, and its proximity to fresh water
and the sea, it may possibly represent an old slave dealer’s
stronghold.</p>

<p><a id="c05sumetli"></a>For some eighteen kilometres south of the
Wadi Khoda, the seaward drainages have not been explored, but they
are believed to be only short wadis, as the high mountains of
Faraid are here only about ten kilometres from the coast. From
guides’ statements, the <span class="bold">Wadi Um Etli</span>,
coursing eastward and draining the south faces of Gebel Um Etli,
enters the sea in about latitude 23° 38′, and there is probably at
least one other short wadi draining to the sea about in latitude
23° 35′ from the north part of Gebel Faraid. The sandy coast-plain
in this region is about five kilometres wide.</p>

<p><a id="c05s21"></a>The <span class="bold">Wadi el
Sorubiab</span>, draining from the north part of Gebel Faraid, and
the <span class="bold">Wadi Bint el Kurdum</span>, draining the
mountains around the remarkable “Bodkin” peak, enter the sea
together by way of a small lagoon in latitude 23° 30′. Another
wadi, for which I could not obtain any name from my guides, drains
the extreme south parts of Gebel Faraid and the north slopes of the
smaller Gebel Fereyid, entering the sea in about latitude 23°
19′.</p>

<p><a id="c05s22"></a><span class="bold">Wadi Rahaba</span>, with a
basin of about 900 square kilometres in area, drains the country
between Gebels Faraid and Abu Dahr. From its head, situated about
six kilometres south-east of Gebel Abu Dahr, there is an easy pass
into Wadi Salib el Azrak, a tributary of Wadi Khoda. About three
kilometres below its head, a feeder called <span class="bold">Wadi
Titai</span> enters Rahaba from the hill country to the east; and a
kilometre lower down, another feeder called <span class="bold">Wadi
Abu Nikheil</span>, comes in from the west. At this point there is
an important well, <span class="bold">Bir Rahaba</span>, sunk in
the alluvium of the wadi floor; this is said to yield good summer
supplies, but was filled up by downwash when I visited it early in
1907. Some three kilometres below Bir Rahaba, a tributary called
<span class="bold">Wadi Abu Reye</span> enters Wadi Rahaba from the
north-west; and there is said to be a well, called <span class=
"bold">Bir Abu Reye</span>, about one and a half kilometres up this
wadi. Another feeder, the <span class="bold">Wadi Um Buerat</span>,
joins Rahaba from the south-west a little further on, and then the
wadi, which has thus far taken a southerly course, turns
south-east, winding considerably for some eight kilometres till it
is joined by its most important feeder, the Wadi el Abiad.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>This
<span class="bold">Wadi el Abiad</span> drains the western side of
the northern peaks of Gebel Faraid, and derives its name from the
white granitic sand which forms its floor. It has a length of some
twenty kilometres and is fed by the <span class="bold">Rod
Elbel</span>, which heads in a sandy plain at the foot of the
highest peak of Faraid, and by the <span class="bold">Wadi Abu
Ribian</span>, which collects the drainage from the lower hill
country west of the Bodkin peak.</p>

<p>About three kilometres lower down than the point of influx of
Wadi el Abiad, Wadi Rahaba receives the <span class="bold">Wadi
Megah</span> as a tributary from the north-west; a well, called
<span class="bold">Bir el Gahlia</span> is said to exist at the
head of this wadi, about twelve kilometres up from its opening into
Wadi Rahaba. Some six kilometres further down, Wadi Rahaba opens
out; its course down to this point has been shut in by high hills,
but now becomes an ill-marked drainage line over a sandy plain. The
plain is broken by small hills, and is limited east and west by
other hills which increase in height further away, forming in fact
the foot-hills of Gebels Orga and Um Tenebda on the west and of
Gebel Faraid on the east. In this part of its course Rahaba
receives several tributaries, the principal being <span class=
"bold">Wadi Hutit</span> from the north-west, <span class=
"bold">Wadi Dagalai lil Rahaba</span> and <span class="bold">Wadi
Abu Had</span> from the east, and <span class="bold">Wadi el
Marafai</span>, which runs for some ten kilometres nearly parallel
to Wadi Rahaba, among low hills two or three kilometres east of the
main Wadi, joining the latter about due west of Gebel Fereyid.</p>

<p>Wadi Rahaba curves round to the south of Gebel Fereyid in a
quadrant of about seven kilometres radius, and then proceeds nearly
due east to reach the sea in about latitude 23° 12′.</p>

<p>The upper parts of Wadi Rahaba, where it is shut in by high
hills, contain many trees and bushes; but the lower parts are more
barren and sandy, the actual drainage line being in places
difficult to define on account of the paucity of vegetation and the
openness of the plain. The total length is about seventy-five
kilometres, and the total fall 450 metres; the slope averages eight
metres per kilometre in the upper twenty-five kilometres, where the
wadi is narrow and shut in, but only five metres per kilometre in
the broad and sandy course which forms the remaining fifty
kilometres.</p>

<p><a id="c05s23"></a><span class="bold">Wadi Hodein</span>, one of
the largest and most important of the seawards draining wadis of
the Eastern Desert, has a basin of nearly 12,000 square kilometres,
or over a square degree of the earth’s surface.<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span> Its main channel, formed by
the union of the Wadis Arned, el Sania, Um Sumur, Saalek, Um Reit,
and el Nom, in latitude 23° 18′, longitude 34° 43′, and reaching
the sea at Bir Shalatein<a id="FNanchor_95"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> in latitude 23° 8′,
longitude 35° 37′, has a length of 108 kilometres and an average
slope of three metres per kilometre. For the first fifteen
kilometres of its course it is shut in by the high sandstone scarps
of Gebel Abraq and Gebel Hodein; but shortly after passing the Abu
Saafa Springs its channel becomes wide and sandy, passing through
lower metamorphic hill country; and in the last twenty-five or
thirty kilometres of its course it is merely an ill-defined
drainage line over the sandy coast-plain. Its lower reaches are
dreary and inhospitable, but its upper-portion is pleasantly
wooded, and contains the perennial springs of Abu Saafa. Wadi
Hodein is remarkable for the large number and length of its
tributary wadis, some of which exceed the main channel itself in
length, while many of them contain wells and form important lines
of communication by leading to easy passes over the main watershed.
In the description which follows, I shall first consider the wadis
which by their union form the head of the main channel, afterwards
tracing the course of the main wadi in detail to the sea, noting
the influx of the various tributaries on either hand, and finally
describing the larger tributaries themselves.</p>

<p>The most important of the wadis which join to form the head of
Wadi Hodein are Wadis Arned, Saalek, and Um Reit. These join in a
small plain with the <span class="bold">Wadis el Sania</span>,
<span class="bold">Um Sumur</span> and <span class="bold">El
Nom</span>, which are smaller and will not need further
mention.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Wadi el Arned</span> originates on the main
watershed about five kilometres south-east of Galt el Aguz. The
watershed here is only 427 metres above sea-level, and is so flat
and sandy that it is almost impossible to say within a kilometre
where the divide actually is; the wadi in fact heads in a sandy
plain about two kilometres wide with low sandstone hills on either
hand, from which feeders join the main drainage line. About six
kilometres below its head, Wadi Arned is joined from the south by
its most important feeder, the <span class="bold">Wadi
Muegil</span>. This wadi, which has a length of some twenty
kilometres, originates in the hill country about nine kilometres
north of Gebel Um<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
Reit, where an easy pass connects it with Wadi Saalek; it flows in
a northerly direction, entirely among sandstone hills, and is
fairly provided with vegetation. Some two kilometres lower down,
Arned receives a smaller feeder from the north, called <span class=
"bold">Wadi Um Arta</span>; by following this up for about five
kilometres, one can reach a rather steep and sandy eastward pass
into the head of Wadi Silsila, and this forms the shortest route
from the Galt el Aguz to the springs of Abraq. About four
kilometres below the junction of Wadi Abu Arta, near an isolated
hill on the east side of the Wadi Arned, there appears to be
another opening into one of the heads of Wadi Silsila; this opening
is very sandy and looks like a practicable alternative route to
Abraq Springs, though it has not been explored. Lower down its
course, Wadi Arned is at first very sandy and bare, with high
sand-drifts swathing the feet of the hills on the east; but it
gradually narrows into a gorge and becomes less sandy, then opens
out again, and near its junction with Wadi Hodein it contains
abundant vegetation. The Wadi Arned forms the easiest and most
direct road from Abu Saafa to Daraw, <em>via</em> Galt el Aguz, Bir
Abu Hashim, and Bir Qoleib.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Wadi Saalek</span> is a short wadi with many
feeders, draining the hills round Gebel Saalek; one of its northern
feeders leads to a pass into the head of Wadi Muegil, while one of
its south branches heads in a pass leading round the west side of
Gebel Um Reit to Wadi and Bir Um Reit.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Wadi Um Reit</span> heads in the granite
mountain called Gebel Um Reit and flows north-eastward, to the
south of the mountain, for about twenty-two kilometres, to its
junction with Arned and Saalek to form Wadi Hodein. The head of
Wadi Um Reit leads to a pass north-west of the mountain into Wadi
Saalek, while the western head of Um Reit, which bears the name
<span class="bold">Wadi el Dub</span>, leads on to a sandy plain
forming the main watershed, whence there are easy tracks to the
various feeders of Wadi Timsah. The well called <span class=
"bold">Bir Um Reit</span> is a deep excavation, in the wadi floor
at the foot of the mountain, near a large tree. Dr. Hume, who
visited it in 1906, found it to yield water of only mediocre
character. It is about one hundred kilometres by road from Bir Abu
Hashim, the nearest well to the west, but only about thirty
kilometres from Abu Saafa Springs, the nearest water eastward; to
get to Abu Saafa from Bir Um Reit,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_118">[118]</span> one has only to follow down the wadi, and
the supply at Abu Saafa can always be relied on for quantity and
quality. Near the well, Wadi Um Reit receives feeders draining the
high granite hills of Etresia; the principal of these is called
<span class="bold">Wadi Malhat</span>. The lower part of the course
of Um Reit is almost entirely in sandstone hills; it has not been
mapped in detail except near its junction with Hodein.</p>

<p>We turn now to the main channel of Wadi Hodein, which
originates, as above-mentioned, by the union of the Wadis Um Reit,
Saalek, Arned, and other smaller wadis in a small plain, and shall
follow its course onwards to the sea. Three small feeders,
<span class="bold">Talet Um Danaqa</span> and <span class=
"bold">Talet Kurit</span> on the south, and <span class=
"bold">Talet Um Sideri</span> on the north, join the channel a few
kilometres below its head, while about nine kilometres from the
head there enters a larger wadi coming from the south, called the
<span class="bold">Wadi el Gihab</span>. The main Wadi Gihab has
not been followed, but its eastern branch, called <span class=
"bold">Wadi Gihab Abu Derb</span>, contains a large and very easily
accessible galt about four kilometres from Hodein, and leads about
ten kilometres further on, to a very steep and difficult pass into
Wadi Dif; this pass is practicable only on foot, being risky even
for unladen camels.</p>

<p>The <span class="bold">Springs of Abu Saafa</span> are situated
in the Wadi Hodein, about two kilometres below the point of influx
of Wadi Gihab, at an altitude of 310 metres above sea-level. The
Wadi Hodein is here narrow, and shut in by very high steep
sandstone scarps. There are four springs, all issuing from the
northern scarp at intervals of about sixty metres along the wadi,
and all about three metres above the wadi floor, trickling into
pools about a metre in diameter close by. The most westerly of the
four springs is a mere trickle; the next yields a rather greater
flow, from a carved niche in the rock, with a Greek cornice; the
third is the one most used, having the greatest flow of the four,
while the easternmost is almost stagnant and has yellow
incrustations near it. The rate of flow, even from the largest
spring, is very slow, probably not more than ten litres per minute,
and the overflow from the pools is only a tiny stream a few
centimetres wide which soon loses itself in the sand of the wadi
floor; but the pools are large enough for a dozen or more camels to
drink from, and soon fill up again when emptied. The water is of
excellent quality, very clear, and the supply never fails. Near the
springs there are five or six small date palms, and the wadi
hereabouts has many other<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_119">[119]</span> trees. After rain, this part of Wadi Hodein
at times becomes a stream; this was the case in October 1907, for I
found numerous pools in the wadi floor, and scum and froth showing
that an impetuous stream about half a metre deep had flowed down
the wadi only a few days prior to my visit. Just below Abu Saafa
Springs, Wadi Hodein receives the short <span class="bold">Wadi
Maghal</span> from the north-west; this wadi, which is walled in by
high sandstone plateaux, contains water holes about three
kilometres from Wadi Hodein; but these are less important than the
springs of Abu Saafa, and are, moreover, off the main road.</p>

<p>Wadi Hodein now opens out, the high sandstone scarps of Gebels
Abraq and Hodein running north and south-east, and enters a sandy
plain with very low hills, from among which some small feeders join
the main wadi. About fifteen kilometres below the opening of
scarps, Wadi Hodein receives, from the north-west, the Wadi
Naam,<a id="FNanchor_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96" class=
"fnanchor">[96]</a> a great tributary draining the mountains of
Zergat Naam, Um Bisilla, and Abu Dahr. The next influx is from Wadi
Dif, which enters Wadi Hodein from the south-west about six
kilometres further on; Wadi Dif itself is only a short wadi, but it
collects the drainage of an immense area to the south by long
feeders, and contains a good well. Nearly opposite to Wadi Dif, the
<span class="bold">Wadi Orga el Atshani</span> joins Wadi Hodein
from the north-west; the Wadi Hodein has here two large island-like
masses of low hills in it, between which the main drainage line
passes. Lower down, <span class="bold">Wadi Orga el Rayani</span>
enters by two mouths from the north. Both the Wadis Orga are said
to originate near Gebel Orga, some thirty kilometres to the north,
but their courses have not been mapped; the one called El Rayani is
said to lead to a good well, <span class="bold">Bir Orga</span>,
about twelve or fourteen kilometres above its junction with Hodein.
On the opposite (south) side, Wadi Hodein receives the Wadi Anfeib,
draining the high sandstone plateau of Gebel Anfeib. A little
further on the small <span class="bold">Wadi el Khasiya</span>
comes in from the north, by two channels, one on either side of a
small group of isolated hills; and nearly opposite is the mouth of
Wadi Madi, which drains the west side of the great mountain mass of
Gerf, some sixty kilometres to the south, and possesses a good well
about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span> fifty
kilometres up its course from Wadi Hodein. Several feeders come in
from the north a little further down the wadi, of which the chief
is the <span class="bold">Wadi Um Tenedba</span>, draining the
mountain of the same name, while others drain the hill country
round Gebel Harhagit. On the other (south) side is the mouth of
Wadi Khashab, draining the west side of Gebel Khashab and the hills
west of it. A few kilometres further on, Wadi Hodein widens
considerably, and from here onward it is very sandy and arid. A
long spur running north-west from Gebel el Anbat nearly cuts across
the wadi, the main channel of which passes north and east of the
spur, while to the west of it is a rather broad sandy plain with
ill-marked drainage lines from the hills, of which the chief bears
the name of <span class="bold">Wadi Um Seleim</span>. Near Gebel el
Anbat are numerous small feeders of Wadi Hodein from that hill and
the other hills to the north-east. About eight kilometres below
Gebel el Anbat, Wadi Hodein quits the hills and, turning a little
north of east, merges into the coast-plain, over which its
remaining course of about twenty-seven kilometres is very
ill-defined. Just where it leaves the hills, Wadi Hodein is joined
from the south-west by Wadi Beida, draining the mountain of the
same name and containing two wells; and a little further on it
receives Wadi el Kreiga, which drains the hill country round Bir
Meneiga. The junctions of Wadi Beida and Wadi Kreiga with Wadi
Hodein are very difficult to trace on the ground, being almost lost
in the general sandy plain.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Bir Shalatein</span>, a very salt well in the
Wadi Hodein, about two kilometres from its mouth and only about
seven metres above the sea, is chiefly of importance by reason of
its marking the administrative limit of the Egyptian and Sudan
spheres of government. It is merely a few shallow pits sunk in the
wadi bed, yielding water drinkable only by camels. An iron beacon
two metres high has been erected on a low bank close to the well,
and will enable the well, which is itself inconspicuous, to be
easily found.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Wadi Naam</span>, a great tributary of Wadi
Hodein coming from the north-north-west, originates about ten
kilometres south-east of Gebel Zergat Naam by the union of the
Wadis Abu Seyal, El Fil, and Um Bisilla, and courses
south-south-east for about forty-nine kilometres to its junction
with Wadi Hodein. It is a very barren wadi, being for most of its
length a broad, shallow, and very sandy drainage line among low
hills, and in its lower parts, where it crosses<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span> the plain of Abraq, its course
is very ill-marked. Its slope decreases from five metres per
kilometre near its head to about three metres per kilometre in its
lower reaches. Besides the three wadis which, as above-mentioned,
unite to form its head, Wadi Naam has several large tributaries, of
which the chief are the Wadis Silsila and Abraq on the west, and
Wadis Erf Um Araka, Arais, and Betan on the east.</p>

<p>The <span class="bold">Wadi el Fil</span>, which may be regarded
as the main head of Wadi Naam, though it is not the longest, drains
the north-east portion of Gebel Zergat Naam (sometimes called Hagar
el Fil). The rocky gullies forming its heads contain rock basins
which yield water for a short time after rain.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Wadi Abu Seyal</span> drains the south part
of the same range; its head is very steep, and is said to contain a
very large galt, which holds supplies of water for five months
after rain.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Wadi Um Bisilla</span> drains Gebel Um
Bisilla, which it half encircles, its main head being north-east of
the mountain, where there is an easy pass into Wadi Abu Nilih, and
thence an easy road to the head of Wadi Lahami. About eleven
kilometres west of the mountain, Wadi Um Bisilla receives, from the
north-east, the <span class="bold">Wadi el Khiua</span>, which,
with its tributaries, <span class="bold">Wadis Abu Fagir</span> and
<span class="bold">Abu Nilih</span>, drains the low hill country
north of Gebel Um Bisilla. The lower parts of Wadis Um Bisilla and
Khiua have not been surveyed in detail; their courses as shown on
the map are only approximate, but being based on guides’ statements
near the spot they are probably substantially correct.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Wadi Erf Um Araka</span> heads as a series of
small wadis among the low hills south of Um Bisilla, and curves
round westward between the high hills of Abu Shigelat and Erf el
Gimal on the north, and Erf Um Araka or Gebel Belamhandeit on the
south, to join Wadi Naam about five kilometres lower down than Wadi
Um Bisilla. The hill country round the heads of Wadi Erf Um Araka
is fairly open, so that one can proceed freely from the head of
Wadi Arais, across those of Wadi Erf Um Araka, and on into the
heads of Wadi Um Bisilla.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Wadi Arais</span> originates by the union of
many small feeders in the low hill country between Gebels Um Guruf
and Hendusi, and courses for the first fourteen kilometres in a
south-south-west direction. About nine kilometres below its head
the <span class="bold">Wadi Um Guruf</span>, draining the hills
round the conspicuous granite boss called Gebel Um Guruf, enters
from the north-west. Some five kilometres further<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span> on, just beyond the place
where Arais makes a sharp westward bend, <span class="bold">Wadi
Belamhandeit</span>, draining the east face of the long gneiss
range called Erf Um Araka or Gebel Belamhandeit, enters from the
north. Wadi Arais now narrows into a winding gorge, cutting
westward for about ten kilometres through the complex of high
gneiss hills called Gebel Arais to join Wadi Naam. Its junction
with Wadi Naam takes place in a small plain, with the sandstone
plateaux of Gebel Um Sididad on the west and the gneiss hills of
Gebel Arais on the east. The fall of Wadi Arais is from 464 metres
above sea at the pass into Wadi Erf Um Araka, to 345 metres where
it joins Wadi Naam after a course of twenty-five kilometres; so
that its slope averages four and a half metres per kilometre.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Wadi Silsila</span><a id=
"FNanchor_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>
heads in high sandstone hills on the meridian of 34° 40′, north of
Gebel Abraq, where at least one pass, steep and sandy, leads to the
Wadi Arned. Its course is almost due east, over a plain with low
sandstone banks, with a great deal of blown sand. Feeders enter it
from the sandstone hills which bound the plain, the principal being
the <span class="bold">Wadi Um Sididad</span>, draining the high
sandstone hills, called Gebel Um Sididad, on the north. About seven
kilometres before it joins Naam, Wadi Silsila cuts through the
range of low sandstone hills which stretches southward from Gebel
Um Sididad to near Abraq springs; in proceeding to Abraq from the
pass at the head of Wadi Silsila, one bears off to the south before
reaching this range, entering the drainage of Wadi Abraq over an
open sandy plain.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Wadi Abraq</span> is a rather ill-defined
drainage line which originates on the north side of Gebel Abraq,
and after skirting the high sandstone scarp, from which it receives
small feeders, for about thirteen kilometres, turns eastward to
join Wadi Naam, about nine kilometres above its junction with
Hodein. Wadi Abraq is sandy and barren, and would be scarcely
worthy of mention but for the fact that it contains some of the
most important water sources of the entire Eastern Desert, the
<span class="bold">Abraq Springs</span>. There are no less than
five springs within a length of as many kilometres of the wadi,
yielding perennial supplies of excellent water.</p>

<p>The first spring from the north, called <span class="bold">Bir
el Sunta</span>, is a pool about two metres in diameter at the
entrance to a little gully in the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_123">[123]</span> face of the high sandstone scarp; it is
very easily accessible to camels, being practically on the plain,
and fills as rapidly as it is emptied. The second and third
springs, called together <span class="bold">Bir Abu Dibesat</span>,
are about 1,500 metres south-east of Bir el Sunta, near the tomb of
Sheikh Hamid; they form smaller pools at the foot of the scarp. The
fourth spring, <span class="bold">Bir Abraq</span>, is situated a
short distance up a stony gully which emerges from the scarp a
little further south; the water lies in large pools under dipping
sandstone beds on the south side of the gully. The fifth spring,
<span class="bold">Bir Gumbit</span>, is said to be some
three<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span> kilometres
further south-east, and, like the others, at the foot of the
sandstone scarp; it has not, however, been visited by the survey
party.</p>

<div class="figcenter iw6">
<figure id="fig02"><a href="images/fig02.png"><img src=
'images/fig02.png' alt=''></a>
<p class="cp1">Fig. 2.—Map of Abraq Springs. Scale: 5 centimetres
to a kilometre.</p>
</figure>
</div>

<p>The water at all the Abraq Springs is of excellent quality; it
contains masses of green algæ, but these are easily avoided in
baling out, and the water can be obtained quite clear. Of the four
springs visited, the one called Bir Abraq is the chief; but Bir el
Sunta is rather easier of access for camels. The springs are
practically all at the same level, <em>viz.</em>, 330 metres above
sea, and all derive their water from the same sandstone beds. No
camel food grows near the wells, and there are very few trees in
the vicinity; consequently, the Arabs of the neighbourhood do not
camp near the springs, but in Wadi Hodein and its tributaries,
drawing water from Abraq or Abu Saafa at intervals. There are,
however, ruins of a large ancient fort on a low hill east of Bir
Abraq, and some Arab graves a little further north; among these
latter is a large tomb said to be that of Sheikh Hamid.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Wadi Betan</span> originates on the north
side of Gebel Abu Dahr, where an easy pass, 610 metres above
sea-level, connects its head with Wadi Um Karaba, and courses at
first westward to near Gebel Hendusi; it then turns southward to
join Wadi Naam a few kilometres only above its junction with Wadi
Hodein. Its total length is over fifty kilometres, and its average
slope is about seven metres per kilometre. Only the head of Wadi
Betan has been surveyed in detail; but this is the most important
part, as containing water sources and old mine workings; and the
lower part of its course as shown on the map is probably
substantially correct, being based on statements made near the spot
by guides familiar with the district.</p>

<p>About five kilometres below its head, Wadi Betan contains the
two wells called <span class="bold">Bir Betan</span>. These are
excavations in the alluvium of the wadi. The lower one is at the
mouth of the small Wadi Um Eleiga, while the other is about 600
metres further up Wadi Betan, close to a small tree. Both these
wells were filled up by downwash when I visited them in February
1907, and their places were only recognisable by the clay “hôds”
near them; at this time there was no necessity for the Arabs to
open them, as a galt at the head of the wadi, just south of the
pass into Wadi Um Karaba, was yielding a good supply of water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>Just above the
wells, Betan receives from the south the feeder called <span class=
"bold">Wadi Mistura</span>, draining the west side of Gebel Abu
Dahr. The little <span class="bold">Wadi Um Eleiga</span>, which
drains into Betan close to the south well, is of importance as
leading to some extensive ruins and old workings about two
kilometres up from its mouth. The ruins are mostly rubble hovels,
while the workings, which were evidently for gold, vary from mere
scratchings to pits ten metres deep in the rock. A diorite
mill-stone is to be seen near the ruins.</p>

<p>The <span class="bold">Wadi Abu Debebi lil Betan</span>, which
joins Betan on the north about three kilometres below the wells,
leads by an easy pass into <span class="bold">Wadi Abu Debebi lil
Khoda</span>, one of the heads of Wadi Khoda, and forms the nearest
way to the coast from Bir Betan. <span class="bold">Wadi Abu
Sieiyil</span> is a small feeder entering Betan from the south,
three kilometres further down. The principal remaining tributaries
of Betan are the Wadis Hefeiri, Abu Beid, and Egat. <span class=
"bold">Wadi Hefeiri</span> runs westward from near the Abu Debebi
pass, and turning south near Gebel Hendusi, receives the
<span class="bold">Rod el Hendusi</span> just before entering
Betan. <span class="bold">Wadi Abu Beid el Azrak</span> originates
near Gebel Abu Sieiyil west of Abu Dahr, and flows southwards to
join <span class="bold">Wadi Abu Beid el Abiad</span>, which in
turn flows into Wadi Betan. A well, <span class="bold">Bir Abu
Beid</span>, is situated near the junction of Wadi Abu Beid el
Abiad and Wadi Abu Beid el Azrak, where there are numerous seyal
trees; it was yielding a fair quantity of good water in 1906. Of
the <span class="bold">Wadi Egat</span>, nothing has been seen; it
is, however, stated by the Arabs to originate in the rugged hilly
tract south of Gebel Abu Dahr, and to join Wadi Betan lower down
its course than Abu Beid.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Wadi Dif</span> originates in the sandstone
hills round Bir Dif, and pursues a very sinuous north-easterly
course, cutting through the high sandstone plateau which is named
Gebel Hodein to the north, and Gebel Dif to the south of it. For
the major part of its length of twenty-nine kilometres it is very
narrow, with very high steep sandstone scarps on either side, but
it is a little more open near its origin, where Wadi Feqoh joins
it, and in its lower part it winds as a broad sandy valley through
the low hills which separate the Wadi Hodein from the high
sandstone plateaux; it joins Wadi Hodein close to the meridian of
35°. Except the Wadi Feqoh, which is of immense length, and drains
a very large area, Wadi Dif has only a few insignificant feeders.
Of these, <span class="bold">Talet Um Karaba</span> and
<span class="bold">Wadi Enqireidia</span> enter<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span> from the south plateau near
the place where Wadi Dif leaves the high sandstone hills; and
<span class="bold">Wadi Gelabat Shabai</span>, coursing north-east
through the low hill country flanking the plateau, joins Wadi Dif
just above its junction with Hodein.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Bir Dif</span> is situated in a small gully
forming the head of Wadi Dif, in latitude 23° 12′ 42″. To a
traveller coming up Wadi Dif, Wadi Feqoh forms the main
continuation of Wadi Dif, and the gully containing Bir Dif appears
to be a lateral tributary coming in from the west; but the Arabs
restrict the name Dif to the drainage line below the spring, and
apply the name Feqoh to all the upper main channel. Bir Dif is a
spring forming two pools of good water, situated about a kilometre
up the gully, at the junction of sandstone and schists. The
approach to the pools is very stony, but camels can easily reach
the water; the spring is 290 metres above sea-level.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Wadi Feqoh</span>, a tributary of Wadi Dif,
is many times longer than Wadi Dif itself, and even longer than the
Wadi Hodein of which Wadi Dif is a tributary, having a length along
its main channel of 150 kilometres, with feeders totalling several
times that length. Though only portions of Wadi Feqoh have been
surveyed in detail, the position of its entire course is known with
tolerable accuracy from the statements of guides at various
stations from which portions of it could be pointed out. It is for
the most part a very barren wadi, forming an ill-defined drainage
line through a dreary waterless sandy waste. Its very name, which
means “devoid of nourishment,” indicates its character. It
originates near the west side of Gebel Soaorib, only some twenty
kilometres north of the 22nd parallel of latitude, where the main
watershed separates it from the feeders of the Wadi Alaqi. From
here it follows a north-westerly course, passing between the
mountains of Eir Arib and Hadal Derqa. Curving slightly to the
north, it crosses the great sandy plain west of Gebel Korabkansi,
and passes close west of the isolated mountain called Gebel Shabih.
Further on, it enters a country of low hills with sandy
interspaces, passing close west of the low range called Gebel Um el
Kalala, and then sweeps round in a great curve towards the east to
join the Wadi Dif close to Bir Dif. The fall of its bed from near
Gebel Shabih to its junction with Wadi Dif, that is, in a length of
seventy-two kilometres, is from 470 metres to 280 metres above sea,
giving an average slope of only about 2·6 metres per kilometre;
Wadi Feqoh has in fact the most gentle gradient of all the great
seawards-draining wadis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>Wadi Feqoh has
many tributaries. Those near its head, and others coming in from
the western mountains through the low hill country north of Gebel
Mishbih, have not been traced; but those draining Gebel Korabkansi
and Gebel Niqrub, which are probably the most important, have been
mapped in detail. Most of the drainage from these localities
eventually finds its way into the great trunk feeder of Wadi Feqoh,
called the <span class="bold">Wadi Gimal</span>,<a id=
"FNanchor_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>
which joins Wadi Feqoh about sixteen kilometres before its junction
with Wadi Dif. The tributaries of Wadi Feqoh are of much more
interest than Wadi Feqoh itself, as they contain in many places a
fair or even relatively rich assemblage of trees and bushes, and at
least one good well, Bir Sararat Seyet.</p>

<p>The most southern tributaries of Wadi Feqoh which have been
mapped are <span class="bold">Wadi Kamoyib</span>, draining
eastward from Gebel Wadhait, and <span class="bold">Wadi
Tawayib</span>, draining the east face of Gebel Korabkansi. These
are for the most part barren wadis each coursing for about sixteen
kilometres across a sandy plain to join Feqoh.</p>

<p>The main head of Wadi Gimal is called <span class="bold">Wadi
Seyet</span>. It originates between Gebel Wadhait and Gebel Dreb
about latitude 22° 35′, and by means of many feeders drains the
east face of Gebels Dreb and Gerf. The principal feeder of Wadi
Seyet from the south-west is <span class="bold">Wadi
Wadhait</span>, collecting the south drainage of Gebel Korabkansi,
while on the east the <span class="bold">Wadi Sherefa el
Gharbi</span>, which leads to the important Sherefa pass,
contributes the drainage from the northern parts of Gebel Dreb and
the south-west parts of Gebel Gerf. These both join Wadi Seyet a
little south of latitude 22° 40′, while a little further down there
enter from the east two small feeders called <span class=
"bold">Wadi Delawet</span> and <span class="bold">Wadi
Buyet</span>. The name Seyet is given to this wadi only down to
where it passes through a narrow gap between high hills in latitude
22° 42′; below that point it is called Wadi Gemal. Wadi Seyet is
remarkably well wooded, containing an immense number of fine large
acacia trees, and presented an almost park-like appearance at the
end of 1907. It also contains a deep well, <span class="bold">Bir
Sararat Seyet</span>, excavated in the wadi floor just above the
gap between the hills above referred to. This well was full of
downwash in the winter of 1907. It is said to be twenty metres deep
and to yield plenty of good water, but at that time there was
plenty of water in galts in the mountains,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_128">[128]</span> and the Arabs said they preferred to derive
their supplies from these so long as they lasted, only digging out
the well when further supplies were necessary.<a id=
"FNanchor_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>
An unnamed feeder from the west, joining Wadi Seyet just below the
well, leads by an easy pass into the head of <span class=
"bold">Wadi Hushenab</span>, which drains through Wadi Sortdau into
the Wadi Gemal lower down its course.</p>

<p>The country between Gebel Korabkansi and Gebel Niqrub Foqani,
through which the course of Wadi Gemal lies, is a gently sloping
plain with mere low banks, among which the drainage lines branch
out forming numerous loops. The main channel runs fairly straight
in a north-westerly direction, receiving <span class="bold">Wadis
Sortdau</span> and <span class="bold">Remalib</span>, draining the
hills north-west of Gebel Korabkansi as tributaries on its west
side; but a sort of loop line runs off eastward and reaches the
main channel again by the <span class="bold">Wadi Haletiai</span>,
which also collects the drainage from the south parts of Gebel
Niqrub Foqani. After passing west of this last-named mountain, Wadi
Gemal takes a more northerly course; it receives an immense number
of feeders from the west and north of Gebel Niqrub Foqani, of which
the principal is called <span class="bold">Wadi Umeiatib</span>.
Other feeders enter from among the low hills on the west, the
principal being <span class="bold">Wadi Hadelshisheib</span>,
coming from the neighbourhood of the dark cone called Gebel Mismih.
From Bir Sararat Seyet to its junction with Wadi Feqoh the length
of the main channel of Wadi Gemal is fifty-seven kilometres, and
its fall is from 560 metres above sea to about 310 metres, or on
the average about four and a half metres per kilometre; its slope
is thus much more rapid than that of Wadi Feqoh, though in its
lower parts, where it passes over what is almost a plain, its
gradient is less than half this average amount. The upper parts of
the Wadi Gemal and its tributaries contain as a rule a fair
abundance of trees and bushes.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Wadi Abu Hashim</span>, which joins Wadi
Feqoh about three kilometres above Bir Dif, commences its course
near Gebel Butitelib, where an easy pass, broad and sandy, 405
metres above sea-level, divides it from the heads of Rod Mukrayib,
a tributary of Wadi Madi. Wadi Abu Hashim follows a north-westerly
course, nearly in a straight line, collecting principally the
drainage from the western slopes of the range of high schist hills
which flank the sandstone plateau<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_129">[129]</span> of Gebel Anfeib. It has a length of
seventeen kilometres, and an average slope of about six metres per
kilometre. It is a fairly open wadi, without much vegetation; on
its west side are only very low hills.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Wadi Anfeib</span>, which enters Wadi Hodein
from the south-west eight kilometres below the point of influx of
Wadi Dif, is formed by the union of three main heads, called
<span class="bold">Wadi Anfeib el Tawayib</span>, <span class=
"bold">Wadi Atalab</span>, and <span class="bold">Wadi
Mitatib</span>, draining respectively the northern, central, and
southern parts of the great sandstone plateau of Gebel Anfeib.
Mitatib is joined half-way down its course by <span class=
"bold">Wadi Unfagalan</span>, which likewise heads in the plateau.
Below the junction of its three main heads, Wadi Anfeib has a
course of only about seven kilometres to run, through low hill
country, before it joins Wadi Hodein.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Wadi Madi</span>, the next great tributary of
Wadi Hodein from the south, heads in the western side of the
complex group of mountains called Gebel Gerf, and courses in a
northerly direction for over seventy kilometres before joining Wadi
Hodein in longitude 35° 7′, five kilometres lower down Wadi Hodein
than the mouth of Wadi Anfeib. The heads of Wadi Madi are extremely
complex, consisting of a multitude of branching drainage lines, and
some of them divide their drainage with the Wadi Gemal, which
enters Wadi Hodein by way of Wadis Feqoh and Dif. The most
southerly head is the <span class="bold">Wadi Difoteb</span>,
draining from the west side of Gebel Gerf in latitude 22° 39′; but
only a part of the drainage from this gets into Wadi Madi, the rest
going into Wadi Sherefa el Gharbi. A similar fate is shared by
<span class="bold">Wadi Eirahimib</span>, which heads in a slightly
difficult pass, leading into Wadi Um Reddam, about three kilometres
west of the highest point of Gebel Gerf in latitude 22° 42′; this
wadi courses in a direction a little south of west, falling very
rapidly, past the hill mass of Gebel Tueiwi, where it divides, part
of its drainage going northwards as Wadi Madi, and part crossing
the plain as Wadi Buyet and joining the Wadi Seyet. The next head
of Wadi Madi to the north is formed by <span class="bold">Wadi
Faditiai</span>, which drains the high hills east of Gebel Tueiwi,
and captures a part of the drainage brought down by the
above-mentioned Wadi Eirahimib. Exactly where the name Madi
commences to be applied to the drainage is uncertain, as Arabs
differ on the point, but it is probably most correct to consider
Madi as commencing just south of Gebel Tueiwi,<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_130">[130]</span> where the drainage of Wadi Eirahimib,
with part of that from Wadi Difoteb, divides into two parts, the
lesser going down Wadi Buyet to join Wadi Seyet, while the greater
forms Wadi Madi itself. On this basis, Wadi Faditiai is a tributary
of Wadi Madi, joining it by several openings between latitudes 22°
44′ and 22° 46′. There are numerous feeders from the low hill
country both to Wadi Faditiai and to Wadi Madi proper. After
receiving Wadi Faditiai, Madi flows in a well-defined trench, with
many trees, north-west for a few kilometres to latitude 22° 47′,
where it turns sharply, almost at a right angle, to the north-east.
A kilometre and a half beyond the bend where there is a high
granite hill on the west side of the wadi, is <span class=
"bold">Bir Madi</span>. This is a well sunk in the alluvium of the
wadi floor, having its mouth lined with stone slabs; in December
1907, when I visited it, the water was four and a half metres deep,
with its surface three and a half metres below the wadi floor, and
the water was good. The wadi floor here is 476 metres above
sea-level. A beacon on the granite hill overlooking the well has
the position latitude 22° 47′ 46″ N., longitude 35° 1′ 38″ E.,
altitude 556 metres above sea. Below the well, Wadi Madi follows a
rather winding course among moderately high hills to a little north
of latitude 22° 50′, where it gets into more open country and
continues as a broad sandy valley, curving gently in a northerly
direction, to latitude 23° 5′. Beyond this point, where it receives
the Rod Mukrayib and the Wadi Kolaiqo from the west and east
respectively, Wadi Madi becomes narrower, and winds about, though
still keeping a general northerly direction, among low hill country
to its junction with Wadi Hodein. Wadi Madi has many tributaries,
the chief being the Wadis Shellal el Gharbi, Tugudbaia, Sinatib,
Atluk and Kolaiqo, and the Rod Mukrayib, which will be treated
separately further on. The upper parts of Wadi Madi and many of its
tributaries are well stocked with trees, but its central parts,
where it is wide and sandy, are more barren. Its principal head,
the Wadi Eirahimib, falls at an average rate of sixteen metres per
kilometre; from near Gebel Tueiwi to Bir Madi the average slope is
nine metres per kilometre; while in the final fifty-four kilometres
of its course from Bir Madi to Wadi Hodein, the average gradient is
rather less than six metres per kilometre.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Wadi Shellal el Gharbi</span>, a tributary of
Wadi Madi, originates in the mountains about six kilometres north
of the highest peak of<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_131">[131]</span> Gebel Gerf, where a pass connects it with
Wadi Shellal el Sharqi, a tributary of the eastward draining Wadi
Radad. Flowing at first nearly due west, Wadi Shellal el Gharbi
receives the <span class="bold">Wadi Um Reddam</span>, which
collects the drainage from the north faces of the highest peaks of
Gebel Gerf. Two of the heads of Um Reddam lead to passes; one
eastward to Wadi Shellal el Sharqi, and one westward into the head
of Wadi Eirahimib. Entering a lower hill country from which it
receives numerous feeders, Wadi Shellal el Gharbi turns north-west
to join Wadi Madi about eight kilometres below Bir Madi. It has a
rather rapid fall, and contains a fair quantity of trees and
bushes. Its total length along its main channel is twenty-one
kilometres.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Wadi Sinatib</span>, which enters Wadi Madi
about six kilometres below Shellal el Gharbi, is a small wadi
coursing north-west through the low hill country north of Wadi
Shellal.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Wadi Tugudbaia</span> conveys to Wadi Madi
the drainage from the dyke country south-east of Gebel Niqrub el
Foqani. It is only a short wadi, and enters Wadi Madi nearly
opposite Sinatib.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Wadi Berendiyeb</span>, which joins Wadi Madi
from the west about latitude 22° 54′, drains the western flanks of
Gebel Niqrub el Foqani. It is a many headed wadi, coursing at first
among the low foot-hills of the mountain, and then crossing almost
a sandy plain to join Wadi Madi. Its length along its main channel
is about twelve kilometres. North of Berendiyeb, there are two
other feeders of Wadi Madi coming from the low hills north-east of
Gebel Niqrub el Foqani; they have no special names, being broad and
sandy and without much vegetation in consequence of their draining
only low country.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Wadi Atluk</span>, which flows into Wadi Madi
from the south-east almost opposite Gebel Niqrub el Tahtani, has a
rather curious origin. It arises from a splitting of the course of
Wadi Korbiai, part of the drainage of which passes eastward down
Wadi Kreiga, while the other part retains its northerly direction
as Wadi Atluk. The total length of Wadi Atluk is about twenty-one
kilometres. It has not been surveyed in detail, but for most of its
course it lies in low hill country.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Rod Mukrayib</span> is a many-branched wadi
which drains the hilly country between Gebel Niqrub el Tahtani and
Gebel Anfeib. One of its heads leads by an easy pass near Gebel
Butitelib into the head of Wadi Abu Hashim; another head drains the
north face of Gebel Niqrub el Tahtani; while a third drains the
south end of Gebel Anfeib,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_132">[132]</span> coursing between the sandstone plateau and
the schist hills west of it. From the pass into Wadi Abu Hashim to
its junction with Wadi Madi the length of its channel is fifteen
kilometres, with a fall of from 405 metres to 250 metres above sea,
giving an average slope of ten metres per kilometre. It joins Wadi
Madi on the north side of an isolated group of hills, just where
Wadi Madi begins to narrow in, about nineteen kilometres above its
junction with Wadi Hodein. From the point where Rod Mukrayib joins
Wadi Madi there is a good open road across the heads of Wadi
Edunqul into those of Wadi Anfeib.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Wadi Kolaiqo</span>, which joins Madi almost
opposite Rod Mukrayib, originates in the hills between Gebel Niqrub
el Tahtani and Gebel Khashab, where a pass at its head leads into
the heads of Wadi Khashab. It is a fairly wide wadi, shut in by
rather high hills, coursing west-north-west with a length of nine
kilometres and a fairly rapid fall.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Wadi Edunqul</span>, a small tributary
entering Wadi Madi, about ten kilometres above its junction with
Wadi Hodein, drains by numerous gullies the south end of Gebel
Anfeib, coursing a little north of east with a length of about
eleven kilometres.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Wadi Khashab</span>, a tributary of Wadi
Hodein, drains by many branches the hilly country east of Gebel
Beida. One of its heads leads to a pass six kilometres due west of
the summit of Gebel Beida, whence there is a road to Bir Beida;
just before reaching the pass, there is a large quartz vein with
some ruins near it. Another feeder of Wadi Khashab, the
<span class="bold">Wadi Dehaiartib</span>, heads in a pass leading
to the head of Wadi Kolaiqo. Wadi Khashab has not been explored
south of 23° 0′. From this parallel to Wadi Hodein its length is
about twenty-six kilometres, but its head may be five kilometres or
more further south. The country on the west side of Wadi Khashab
consists of low hills, but on the east it drains very high hills,
and its feeders course in trenches across the stony slopes at the
feet of the hills to join the main channel. Wadi Khashab contains
large numbers of trees, whence its name (Khashab = wood). Its
average slope is about eight metres per kilometre.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Wadi Beida</span> originates at a pass 395
metres above sea-level, six kilometres west of the summit of Gebel
Beida, where a road leads over into Wadi Khashab. From the pass
Beida courses south-east<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_133">[133]</span> for seven kilometres, receiving feeders
from the high hills on either side. It then turns abruptly at an
acute angle, following a northerly direction for one and a half
kilometres; then turning east for one kilometre, it receives a
great feeder draining the south slopes of Wadi Beida, afterwards
turning south for one and a half kilometres to a point marked by
the ruin of a small well built stone structure, in which mortar and
stucco has been used. From this point the wadi follows a winding
course, at first south-east but gradually working round into a
north-easterly direction, as a narrow gorge through the high hills
of Gebel Beida. Just where the wadi begins to turn northward, about
one and a half kilometres below the ruin above-mentioned, are the
two wells called <span class="bold">Bir Beida</span>. The upper
well is at the opening of a defile leading south-eastward to a
pass, forming the point of departure in the nearest road from Bir
Beida to Bir Meneiga; this well was dry in November 1907. The lower
well is about 500 metres further down the wadi, at a sharp bend in
its course; it is an excavation in the alluvium of the wadi floor,
and was yielding good water in 1907 from a depth of about six
metres. The Arabs say that the supply at this well only fails after
three or four years without rainfall, but the water only
infiltrates slowly, so that after it has been emptied by a caravan
it requires a day or so to refill. The top of the well is 205
metres above sea-level.</p>

<p>About four kilometres below the well, Wadi Beida emerges from
the high hills, and crosses a tract of much lower hill country
seven kilometres wide, receiving in this part of its course many
feeders from the eastern face of Gebel Beida; it then divides,
still preserving its general north-easterly direction, into a
number of shallow channels coursing across the sandy plain to join
the Wadi Hodein.</p>

<p>From Bir Beida the nearest wells are Bir Meneiga and Bir
Shalatein; the water of the latter is, however, very salt and only
drinkable by camels. To Bir Meneiga, a distance of thirty-seven
kilometres, the track leads over the pass already mentioned
south-east of the upper (dry) well, thence into Wadi Kreiga, and up
that wadi into Wadi Meneiga; the road is rather stony near Meneiga,
and rises rapidly, so plenty of time should be allowed. To reach
Bir Shalatein, forty kilometres distant, one descends Wadi Beida
into Wadi Hodein and follows Wadi Hodein towards the sea; the road
is easy, being mostly across a falling sandy plain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span><span class=
"bold">Wadi Kreiga</span>, the last great tributary of Wadi Hodein,
originates by the union of the Wadis Korbiai and Meneiga, both
draining that north extension of the mountain mass of Gebel Gerf
which is sometimes called Gebel Korbiai or Gebel Meneiga.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Wadi Korbiai</span> and <span class=
"bold">Wadi Meneiga</span> have their heads only separated by a
narrow mountain ridge, but there is no possible track over this
ridge from one to the other. In each case the wadi contains two
water sources near its head, and the limit of “navigability” of the
wadi is formed practically by these sources, above which there are
steep stony gorges.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Bir Korbiai</span> consists of two wells,
both situated at the foot of a sudden drop in the rocky bed of Wadi
Korbiai, about 150 metres apart, sunk in the bouldery alluvium;
there is some rude timbering at the mouth of the wells over which a
large stone is placed to prevent infilling by downwash. In December
1907 both wells contained abundance of excellent water, only a
metre below ground level. Both wells are easily accessible, though
the road to them is stony. The wells are stated to yield good
supplies for three or four years after rain has fallen, but after
longer drought they only yield a little.</p>

<p>Below the wells, Wadi Korbiai sweeps round in a semicircle of
about three kilometres radius round the west flank of the hills to
join Wadi Meneiga. On its right side are the steep slopes of Gebel
Korbiai, but on the left is lower hill country. Small feeders enter
from both sides. The bed of the wadi is stony, but there are a fair
number of trees in it. Only a part of the drainage of Wadi Korbiai
turns eastward to join Wadi Meneiga in forming Wadi Kreiga; the
other part pursues a northerly course into the Wadi Atluk, a
tributary of Wadi Madi.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Bir Meneiga</span> is important, not only as
giving a perennial supply of good water, but also as marking a
point on the administrative frontier of Egypt and the Sudan. It
consists of two springs in the stony bed of Wadi Meneiga, near its
head. The northern spring is taken as marking the frontier; its
position is latitude 22° 47′ 8″ N. longitude 35° 12′ 20″ E.,
altitude 605 metres above sea-level. The southern spring is about
320 metres further up the wadi, at a level four or five metres
higher. Each of the springs consists of a tiny pool among the rocks
of the wadi floor, easily accessible to camels. The pools only
contain eight or ten gallons each, but camels can drink<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span> as fast as they like and the
pool keeps full. The water is excellent. There are numerous ruins
at Bir Meneiga; they consist of rude rubble hovels and extend for
over a kilometre down the wadi below the springs.</p>

<p>Above the springs, Wadi Meneiga soon becomes impassable, ending
in rocky gorges in the mountains. Below the springs it courses for
about seven kilometres in a direction a little west of north to
join Wadi Korbiai and form the head of Wadi Kreiga. The fall in
this seven kilometres is 200 metres, so that the slope is the
phenomenally rapid one of twenty-eight metres per kilometre, and of
course the floor of the wadi is very stony and camel progress is
very slow. There are several lateral feeders, including one from
the east, three kilometres below the springs, leading to the head
of Wadi Radad; but I am not sure whether the pass is practicable as
I only saw it from the mountain top.</p>

<p>From the mouth of Wadi Meneiga, Wadi Kreiga courses about 15°
north of east, as a fairly wide wadi with a stony floor, with high
hills on either side from which small feeders enter. The first
large feeder, the <span class="bold">Wadi Abiad</span>, enters from
the north-west, six kilometres below the mouth of Wadi Meneiga; it
is a steeply falling wadi, which, like all wadis bearing the name
of Abiad, has a floor of light-coloured granitic sand. Some eight
kilometres lower down, two feeders enter from opposite sides: that
from the north is called <span class="bold">Wadi Eberer</span>,
while that from the south bears the name of <span class="bold">Wadi
Shigeg</span>. Neither of these has been followed up far, and their
length is unknown; but they are believed to be of no great extent.
Below this point the country opens out considerably, and the wadi
anastomoses round low hills, while its floor becomes less stony and
more easy under foot. The various channels unite again about eight
kilometres further down, where the wadi receives a tributary from
the north-west just before it passes the high hill mass which forms
the southward extension of Gebel Beida. This tributary leads to an
easy pass, forming a direct road to Bir Beida. Lower down several
lateral feeders come into Kreiga from either side, and the wadi
emerges on to a sandy plain with scattered low hills. Across this
plain Kreiga takes a more northerly direction for about sixteen
kilometres to join the Wadi Hodein. The length of Wadi Kreiga from
the mouth of Wadi Meneiga to Wadi Hodein is about fourty-one
kilometres. Its fall between these points<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_136">[136]</span> is from 405 metres to about 70 metres above
sea-level, giving an average slope of eight metres per kilometre;
the slope in the upper parts, where the wadi bed is stony, is of
course somewhat greater, and that in its lower more sandy reaches
is somewhat less than this average.</p>

<p><a id="c05s24"></a><span class="bold">Wadi Kolaiqo</span> is a
very ill-defined drainage line heading in the low hills called
Gebel Kolaiqo, and coursing north-east for about thirty kilometres
across the sandy coast-plain to reach the sea about latitude 23°
0′. It is very sandy, and absolutely barren except for a little
scrub in its upper parts. It would hardly have been noticed had not
the triangulation station on the hill at its head been
occupied.</p>

<p><a id="c05s25"></a><span class="bold">Wadi Shab</span>, with a
basin of about 1,250 square kilometres, drains the eastern and
southern portions of the great group of mountains of which Gebel
Gerf is the centre, and reaches the sea in latitude 22° 52′, a
little to the north of Mersa Shab. It has a great number of heads,
most of which bear special names, the name Shab being applied
collectively to them from the locality near the hill of Qrein
Salama, about forty kilometres from the sea, where they begin to
unite together into one great trunk channel. From the circumstance
that its heads are situated in a high mountain mass where the
rainfall is relatively great, and moreover have steeply falling
stony beds which absorb but little of the precipitation, the upper
portions of Shab and its feeders are well stocked with trees. Only
in the last stages of its course to the sea, where the absorption
of its drainage by the sandy coast plain becomes great, does the
abundance of vegetation fall off and the channel become barren. Its
principal heads and feeders are Wadi Radad (fed by Wadi Shellal el
Sharqi), Wadi Tikosha, Wadi Muqur (fed by Wadi Ti Ilak), Wadi
Qadiloi (fed by Tilat Tihu Shana), Wadi Baaneit, Wadi Kilanai, Wadi
Um Saha, Wadi Diqdib, Wadi Sherefa el Sharqi, and Kwat Hewah. At
least three of these contain good water sources, Bir Muqur, Bir
Baaneit, and Bir Diqdib being situated in the upper parts of the
wadis bearing the same names. The various heads and feeders of Shab
will be described in detail below, commencing from the northernmost
one.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Wadi Radad</span> may be more properly
described as a tributary than as one of the heads of Wadi Shab, as
it joins the trunk wadi some fifteen kilometres below the other
feeders. It originates in a rugged tract of high hills near Bir
Meneiga, and courses eastward<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_137">[137]</span> for about thirty-six kilometres, joining
Wadi Shab on the coast-plain near the low hills of Ti Qireira,
about twenty-four kilometres up from the point where Wadi Shab
enters the sea. It has not been surveyed in detail, but its course
was mapped from the triangulation station of Gebel Gerf and from
other occupied stations whence portions of it were visible.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Wadi Shellal el Sharqi</span>, a large feeder
of Wadi Radad, originates in the mountains between Bir Diqdib and
Bir Muqur. It has many heads, the best known of which is one coming
from the west, leading to a pass into Wadi Shellal el Gharbi, a
tributary of Wadi Madi; while another, a little further south,
leads to another pass into Wadi Um Reddam and forms a possible road
to Bir Sararat Seyet. Wadi Shellal el Sharqi follows generally a
northward course, with a rapid fall, and joins Wadi Radad about
eighteen kilometres below the head of the latter.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Wadi Muqur</span> heads in the eastern
mountains of the Gerf group, which are sometimes called Gebel
Muqur. Here the drainage from several steeply falling rocky gullies
collects into a single winding gorge shut in by the mountains. The
limit to which camels can go up the gorge is marked by a well
called <span class="bold">Bir Muqur</span>. At the time of my visit
to this, in February 1908, the well was filled up by debris,
through which, however, the water constantly rose and trickled into
pools in a series of rock basins at slightly lower levels. The flow
was at the rate of about five litres per minute, the overflow from
the basins running to waste at this rate in the sand of the wadi.
The water was of excellent quality. The Arabs state that when the
water ceases to flow as a spring they dig out the debris and use
the place as a well. Below the well, Wadi Muqur pursues a winding
course north-eastward for about two and a half kilometres; then,
receiving the short <span class="bold">Wadi Ti Ilak</span>,
draining the mountains to the west, it turns sharply eastward and
emerges from the high hills into lower country about three
kilometres further on. In the lower country the wadi changes its
direction to east-north-east, receiving many feeders from among the
low hills west of Qrein Salama, and its bed divides and anastomoses
into a series of channels, which eventually unite just before it
enters Wadi Shab, five kilometres north-east of Qrein Salama. From
near its head at Bir Muqur to its junction with Shab, Wadi Muqur
has a length along its main channel of about nineteen kilometres;
it falls from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span> 470
metres above sea-level at the well to 200 metres at its junction
with Shab, so that the average gradient is about fourteen metres
per kilometre.</p>

<p>A few kilometres before reaching Wadi Shab, Wadi Muqur is joined
by the <span class="bold">Wadi Tikosha</span>, draining the
moderately high hills which lie between Wadi Radad and Gebel Muqur,
and winding among low hills over the plain.</p>

<p>The <span class="bold">Wadis Qadiloi</span> and <span class=
"bold">Baaneit</span> drain from the east faces of Gebel Muqur and
the mountains and hills close south and east of it, into Wadi Shab.
There is an eastward extension of hills from Gebel Muqur, partly
drained by <span class="bold">Tilat Tihu Shana</span>, which flows
into Wadi Qadiloi; south of this extension there is a sort of bay,
occupied by lower hills separating Wadi Qadiloi from Wadi Baaneit,
through which several cross channels connect the two wadis.
<span class="bold">Bir Baaneit</span> is a small well in Wadi
Baaneit, near its head; it is said to yield water always, but
refills slowly, so that only six to ten camels can be watered at
once. A little below the well, Wadi Baaneit leaves the hills and
courses north-east across a rapidly falling stony plain. On the
plain, south of the main channel, are the two ruins called
<span class="bold">Darahib Baaneit</span>. They are built of rubble
stone set in plaster, with stucco facing in places, and appear to
be ancient Moslem tombs, the larger one having evidently once
supported a dome; there are about twenty Arab graves near the
ruins.</p>

<p>South of Wadi Baaneit the plain is crossed by many drainage
channels coursing north-east to join Wadi Shab, and the plain is
covered here with quite a park-like growth of acacia trees. The
principal channel, which comes from the hills about four kilometres
south Bir Baaneit, is called <span class="bold">Wadi
Kilanai</span>.</p>

<p>A little south of Wadi Kilanai the plain cuts far back to the
west, and the drainage entering this portion comes from the heart
of the Gerf mountains to the north-west. A large isolated granite
hill-mass called Kilia Arib and numerous smaller hills break the
monotony of the plain and cause much branching and looping of the
drainage channels. The principal artery draining the south parts of
Gebel Gerf is the <span class="bold">Wadi Diqdib</span>, which
originates on the south flanks of the highest peaks, right in the
heart of the mountain mass. In one of the heads is a well called
<span class="bold">Bir Diqdib</span>, which, though of great
service to the Koatil Arabs who inhabit this district with their
camels and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span> other
animals, is of little importance to the traveller because of its
situation in a closed-in wadi and thus not being on any route. From
its head, Wadi Diqdib courses south-westward for fifteen kilometres
or more among the mountains, receiving many feeders, before it
emerges on to the plain. On leaving the mountains it splits up,
part of its drainage going round by the north side of Kilia Arib,
and part by the south, in each case by a number of anastomosing
channels.</p>

<p>The <span class="bold">Wadi Um Saha</span> drains the hills
south-west of Bir Baaneit, and after coursing southwards among the
mountains turns the corner and runs north-east across the plain to
Wadi Shab.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Wadi Sherefa el Sharqi</span>, which drains
the south portion of the Gerf <em>massif</em> and the north-east
flanks of Gebel Dreb, heads in the important Sherefa pass, 807
metres above sea-level, and forming the direct route from Gebel
Hamra Dom and Gebel Um Rasein to Bir Sararat Seyet by way of Wadi
Sherefa el Gharbi. The pass is a fairly easy one, though the fall
is rapid, especially on the east side, where Wadi Sherefa el Sharqi
falls no less than one hundred metres in the first two kilometres
of its course. A feeder which enters Wadi Sherefa el Sharqi from
the south about two kilometres below the pass is said to lead by
another pass to a well called <span class="bold">Bir Bint el
Dreb</span>, situated at the head of <span class="bold">Wadi
Dreb</span>, a tributary of Wadi Feqoh. For the first seven
kilometres of its east-south-easterly course below the pass,
Sherefa el Sharqi is shut in by very high hills, from which
numerous feeders join it; it then divides just before reaching the
great white granite hills called Eir Arib, part of its drainage
going southward to join Kwat Hewah, and part continuing its course
on the north side of the granite hills to join Diqdib near the
granite cones of Tibashoi and thence turning northwards over a
large sandy plain to enter Wadi Shab.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Kwat Hewah</span> drains the eastern flanks
of Gebel Dreb and the north flanks of G. Medarai. Its heads unite
to form a series of channels in a small plain south-west of Eir
Arib, and here it receives a contribution from Wadi Sherefa el
Sharqi as mentioned above. As it passes Eir Arib, Kwat Hewah
divides, part of its drainage curving round to the north to join
that of Wadi Diqdib and Wadi Sherefa el Sharqi on its way to Wadi
Shab, and the remainder going south-west to join the Wadi Medarai.
From the head of Kwat Hewah there is said to be an easy pass into
the Wadi el Krim, a tributary of Wadi Feqoh.</p>

<p><a id="c05s26"></a><span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_140">[140]</span><span class="bold">Wadi Ibib</span>, which
drains the eastern slopes of Gebels Medarai, Abu Hireiq, and Abu
Hodeid, and the eastern and northern faces of Gebels Soaorib, Adar
Qaqa, Leqaq, Um Seleim, Qidmib, Orgem, and Um Bishtit, as well as
Gebel Hamra Dom and the smaller hills south of it, is formed by the
union of the Wadis Hasium and Medarai, a little east of Gebel Um
Rasein, and enters the sea at Mersa Shab. It has a drainage basin
of about 1,800 square kilometres. Including Wadi Hasium, which is
simply the upper portion of Ibib, its total length along its main
channel is slightly over one hundred kilometres. Its principal
tributaries are the Wadis Shinai, Abu Hodeid, Abu Hireiq, Medarai,
Soaorib, and Um Bishtit.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Wadi Hasium</span>, which forms the upper
portion of Wadi Ibib, originates on the main watershed in about
latitude 22° 10′ and longitude 35° 15′; a pass leads from its head
on to a stony plain, whence a track leads to Miti Kwan, a tributary
of Wadi Alaqi. Near its head, Wadi Hasium contains a small well
called <span class="bold">Bir Kagog</span>. A few kilometres
further down, the short <span class="bold">Wadi Mantil
Hasium</span>, draining the western face of Gebel Adar Qaqa, enters
from the east, while the <span class="bold">Wadi Hilwit
Hasium</span>, draining the mountain of the same name and
containing a galt near its head, joins Wadi Hasium from the west.
Continuing its course northward past the mountains of Adar Qaqa and
Leqaq, Wadi Hasium enters an extensive sandy plain, open to the
north, bounded on the west by the mountains of Abu Hodeid and Um
Rasein, on the south by those of Leqaq and Um Seleim, and on the
east by those of Qidmib and Orgem. This plain, which averages
fifteen kilometres in width, is broken by low hills, the principal
of which, Gebel Hamra Tit, Kulet Meiqrum, and Kulet Tinasal, rise
to considerable heights. Hasium courses slightly east of north near
the western edge of this plain to near Gebel Um Rasein, then curves
to the east across it, receiving the Wadi Medarai and becoming Wadi
Ibib. In its northward course through the plain, Wadi Hasium
receives a number of important tributaries from the western
mountains, besides a few smaller feeders from the mountains to the
south and from the hills on the plain. These may be briefly
described in order.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Wadi Shinai</span>, draining the hills south
of Gebel Abu Hodeid, courses a little south of east and enters Wadi
Hasium about latitude 22° 19′; it has not been surveyed in detail,
but it contains a well known water source, <span class="bold">Bir
Shinai</span>, which is said to be about seven kilometres from its
junction with Hasium.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span><span class=
"bold">Wadi Delawet</span>, another small feeder which likewise
drains the hills south of Abu Hodeid, and enters Wadi Hasium about
three kilometres below Wadi Shinai, is of importance as leading to
a camel track over hills which forms the means of access to
<span class="bold">Bir Odis Maaleq</span>, I have not visited this
water source, but it is said to yield immense quantities of good
water, and to be situated at a rather high level in the head of a
small wadi called <span class="bold">Wadi Odis</span>, a tributary
of Abu Hodeid. It appears to be a spring fed by the rainfall on the
surrounding high mountains, the overflow filling large rock basins.
The reason why it is approached by the Wadi Delawet and the track
over the mountains, instead of by ascending Wadi Abu Hodeid and the
Wadi Odis directly, is that the latter route is very difficult for
camels owing to the steep and stony nature of the wadi floor; it
is, however, possible to use this route on foot. As nearly as I
could make out from my guides’ statements, the total distance of
Bir Odis Maaleq from the mouth of Wadi Delawet is about nine
kilometres, of which the first four are in the Wadi Delawet and the
remaining five on the hill track. The distance by the other route
from Bir Abu Hodeid is about four kilometres, some of which is
climbing. My native assistant, who was sent to erect the beacon on
Gebel Abu Hodeid, took two and a half hours to go on foot from Bir
Abu Hodeid to Bir Odis Maaleq, and estimated the latter spring to
be some 150 metres higher than Bir Abu Hodeid.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Wadi Abu Hodeid</span>, which drains the
mountain mass of the same name, lies to the east of the highest
peaks of Gebel Abu Hodeid and is shut in between them and another
high range further east. It has a general south-south-easterly
direction, and a very rapid fall. Its principal feeder is the short
Wadi Odis above referred to, which falls into it from the west
about six kilometres below its head. About one and a half
kilometres below the point of influx of Wadi Odis, there is a large
and important spring of good water in the wadi, called <span class=
"bold">Bir Abu Hodeid</span>. Though I have not visited this
spring, its situation is shown on the map with tolerable accuracy,
as its position with regard to neighbouring triangulated points was
indicated by the guides. My native assistant, who passed the spring
on his way to erect the beacon on Gebel Abu Hodeid, reported it to
be very similar to the springs of Abu Saafa in appearance, though
the latter are in a different rock. From its position in the midst
of high mountains,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
Wadi Abu Hodeid must at times of rainfall collect a great deal of
water, and this explains the constant supplies yielded by the
spring. Above the spring, the steepness of the wadi renders its
ascent very difficult for loaded camels, and there is no road
through its head, but guides state that there is good grazing at
certain seasons in its upper parts, and animals are taken there to
feed. Below the spring, the wadi opens out and curves eastward
round the foot of the remarkable rounded peak of Abu Hodeid Oqla to
join Wadi Hasium on the plain.</p>

<p>The <span class="bold">Rod Anut Berer</span>, which joins Wadi
Hasium about the same point as Wadi Abu Hodeid but from the
opposite side, drains the mountains of Leqaq and Um Seleim which
bound the plain to the south.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Wadi Tikraneib</span>, a small wadi full of
trees, drains a jagged range north of Abu Hodeid Oqla, and joins
Wadi Hasium on the plain by several channels.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Wadi Abu Hireiq</span>, draining the
mountains of the same name, originates about latitude 22° 27′. On
leaving the high mountains its channel divides, part of the
drainage going north-east as Wadi Merdiyeb, and part south-east as
Wadi Abu Hireiq. This latter wadi passes between the main mountains
and a high isolated range of hills for about seven kilometres, then
curves round to the eastward to join Wadi Hasium. There are
numerous loopings and branchings of the wadis in this
neighbourhood, caused by the feeders from the hills and by the
presence of isolated hill masses, which the drainage lines
frequently encircle, and it becomes impossible to say which of the
various channels is the main wadi, so that the name Wadi Abu Hireiq
is applied to all of them collectively.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Wadi Odruk</span> is a small wadi draining
between two groups of high hills south-west of Gebel Um Rasein; it
joins one of the channels of Wadi Abu Hireiq about four kilometres
above its junction with Hasium.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Wadi Nilateib</span>, another small wadi
further north, drains the south end of Gebel Um Rasein and the
north-east faces of the hills close south-west of it. Coursing at
first south-east for about three kilometres, it then curves round
the foot of Gebel Um Rasein to join Wadi Hasium by two channels.
There is a clear passage from the heads of both Wadi Odruk and Wadi
Nilateib into Wadi Merdiyeb. All the wadis hereabouts contain
plenty of trees and scrub, especially<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_143">[143]</span> in their upper parts; as Wadi Hasium is
approached they become more sandy and barren. It is, of course, the
presence of vegetation available for grazing which determines the
possession of a name by such small wadis as these two.</p>

<p>The drainage from the east face of Gebel Um Rasein joins Wadi
Hasium directly by many small channels, which appear not to bear
any special name.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Wadi Medarai</span>, which forms the Wadi
Ibib by its junction with Hasium, ten kilometres due east of Gebel
Um Rasein, has its main head in Gebel Medarai, its length along its
main channel being about twenty-five kilometres. By numerous
tributaries, many of which contain abundance of trees and scrub, it
drains the whole of the high hill country between Gebel Medarai and
Gebel Um Rasein, and it also takes a part of the drainage from Kwat
Hewah. One of its heads is said to lead to a rather difficult pass,
south of Gebel Medarai, into the <span class="bold">Wadi
Kirwau</span>, a tributary of Feqoh. For the first ten kilometres
or so of its length, Wadi Medarai courses a little north of east;
it then receives the feeder from Kwat Hewah above referred to, and
changes its direction to a little south of east, passing close
north of Gebel Um Rasein on its way to join Wadi Hasium on the
sandy plain of the numerous feeders of Wadi Medarai from the hills
west and north of Um Rasein, the principal is <span class=
"bold">Wadi Merdiyeb</span>, which originates ten kilometres
south-west of Gebel Um Rasein by the splitting of Wadi Abu Hireiq.
From this point of origin, it runs in a north-easterly direction in
a rather sinuous course among the hills for about twelve or
thirteen kilometres, joining Wadi Medarai close north of Gebel Um
Rasein. Another little feeder of Wadi Medarai, though only about
two kilometres long, is of some importance from its leading to
<span class="bold">Bir Um Rasein</span>, a small well among the
north foot-hills of Gebel Um Rasein.</p>

<p>Vegetation ceases to be abundant both in Wadi Medarai and in
Wadi Hasium before their junction to form Wadi Ibib, and Wadi Ibib
itself is for the most part a barren sandy ill-defined channel
coursing north-eastward across a dreary plain for some fifty-seven
kilometres to Mersa Shab. In this fifty-seven kilometres its fall
is very nearly 300 metres, giving an average slope of only a little
over five metres per kilometre. The slope of the lower part of Wadi
Hasium is rather steeper than this, while that of Wadi Medarai is
about twice as great.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>But though Wadi
Ibib itself is barren, it has some great tributaries which contains
abundance of trees and scrub in their upper reaches, as well as
several wells. The principal of these tributaries are the Wadis
Soaorib and Um Bishtit, which with their feeders drain the
mountains of Soaorib, Qidmib, Orgem, and Um Bishtit, while other
smaller tributaries drain the lower hills north-east of Um Bishtit
and Gebel Hamra Dom.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Wadi Soaorib</span> originates in the midst
of high mountains a little south of latitude 22° 10′, between the
southern portion of Gebel Soaorib and the range which extends
southwards from Hadal Aweib Meisah. At its head is a difficult pass
westward into the head of Miti Kwan, a tributary of Alaqi. Curving
at first eastward, it soon takes on a north-westerly direction, and
in latitude 22° 11′ 30″ reaches a small open space called
<span class="bold">Mitba</span>; here it is met by several
tributary wadis of which the principal is the <span class=
"bold">Wadi Haiyo</span>, draining the eastern slopes of Gebel
Soaorib. From Mitba the direction of Wadi Soaorib becomes more
northerly, and about nine kilometres below Mitba it turns to the
west, emerging from the mountains into the more open country which
forms the south end of the great plain already referred to. Here it
is joined by the <span class="bold">Wadi Hankuk</span>, draining
north-eastward from Gebel Adar Qaqa, and a few kilometres further
on by the <span class="bold">Wadi Dishlo</span>, which drains the
western flanks of Hadal Aweib Meisah and enters Soaorib from the
east. About three kilometres below the point of influx of Wadi
Dishlo, Wadi Soaorib is joined from the south-west by another
tributary which drains the west side of Gebel Um Seleim. From this
point onwards, Wadi Soaorib courses a little east of north in a not
very well defined course for about twenty-two kilometres over a
gently falling sandy plain, joining Ibib to the north-west of the
sand-swathed hills called Baqari Daba. In this part of its course,
Wadi Soaorib receives small feeders from among the hills west of it
on the plain, the principal of them draining north-eastward between
the hills called Kulet Meiqrum and Kulet Tinasal. It also receives
more important tributaries from the mountains to the east of it,
the principal of these being the Wadis Eimya and Qidmib.
<span class="bold">Wadi Eimya</span> drains the western face of
Gebel Qidmib, while <span class="bold">Wadi Qidmib</span> drains
the northern parts of the same mountain. Wadi Qidmib has two main
heads; the western one lies between two high mountain ridges, and
contains a well called <span class="bold">Bir Qidmib</span>, while
the eastern one leads<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_145">[145]</span> to a steep pass by which Wadi Meisah can be
reached. Before reaching Wadi Soaorib, Wadi Qidmib is joined by
other feeders draining the western flanks of Gebel Orgem and Baqari
Daba.</p>

<p>From its head at the pass into Miti Kwan to its junction with
Ibib, Wadi Soaorib has a length of about fifty kilometres. The
level of the pass is unknown, but from Mitba to Ibib the level of
the wadi floor falls from 505 metres above sea to 260 metres in a
length of about forty-one kilometres, giving an average slope of
six metres per kilometre. Most of the upper portions of Wadi
Soaorib and its tributaries are well stocked with trees and bushes,
but as the wadi crosses the sandy plain it becomes more and more
barren. The place where it enters on the plain in latitude 22° 20′
marks a tribal boundary, the upper parts, including Wadi Dishlo,
belonging to the Balgab Arabs, while the lower parts, including
Wadis Eimya and Qidmib, are Kurbeilab territory.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Wadi Um Bishtit</span>, which joins Wadi Ibib
some five kilometres lower down its course than does Wadi Soaorib,
heads in a small open space in latitude 22° 26′ and longitude 35°
35′. At its head there are two easy passes, one leading northward
into the head of Wadi Habliai, another tributary of Wadi Ibib, and
the other southward into the heads of Wadi Meisah. Just below its
head Wadi Um Bishtit is joined by the small <span class="bold">Wadi
Delawet</span>, draining the hills close to the south; while a
little lower down is another small tributary from a rocky gorge
among the south hills, which is important as leading to
<span class="bold">Bir Um Bishtit</span>. This well, which was
filled by downwash when I visited it in March 1908, is situated in
the floor of the gorge at a sharp bend, about a kilometre up from
the main wadi. According to the guides, it requires excavating
about five metres deep, and yields water in quantity for about a
year after rain, but when there has been no rain for a year only
small supplies can be got, as it fills slowly; at the time of my
visit there was no necessity to open the well because there was
plenty of water in galts in the mountains of Meis-heit-ar, a little
further south. The well is easy of access, and lies at 330 metres
above sea-level.</p>

<p>The total length of Wadi Um Bishtit is about fourteen
kilometres. In the first half of its course it runs north-westward,
shut in by high hills, and contains abundance of small trees. After
cutting through the hills it receives the Wadi Orgem from the
south, and turns northward in opening country to join Wadi Ibib
north of the hills called<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_146">[146]</span> Adar Aweib Um Bishtit. Its average slope is
about nine metres per kilometre.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Wadi Orgem</span>, which joins Wadi Um
Bishtit about four kilometres below the gorge containing the well,
has its head at an easy pass near the remarkable peak of O Shakafa;
this pass leads into Wadi Meisah, about three kilometres above Bir
Meisah. From the pass, the Wadi Orgem runs between the high hill
ranges of Orgem and Um Bishtit, in a direction a little west of
north, for about sixteen kilometres to its junction with Wadi Um
Bishtit.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Wadi Habliai</span>, which heads in an easy
pass about three kilometres east of Bir Um Bishtit, and runs
northwards for about ten kilometres to join Wadi Ibib, is a broad
sandy and rather barren wadi draining gneiss hills; the hills on
the east are much lower than those on the west, and their feet are
swathed in drift sand.</p>

<p>The last feeders of Wadi Ibib are those draining from the
isolated range of high granite hills called Gebel Hamra Dom. These
feeders are very numerous, some coming from the west side of the
hills and curving round its south end to join Wadi Ibib, while
others from the east side course east and north-east over the plain
directly into Wadi Ibib. They contain numerous small trees near
their heads, and after rain there springs up short grass in this
locality, affording for short periods grazing for great flocks of
sheep. The most northerly drainage channel from the east side heads
in the hills a little north of the highest peaks, and here, after
rain has fallen recently, shallow wells are dug in the sand and
yield good water. The place where the wells are is called
<span class="bold">Ti Dabei Hamra Dom</span>. One cannot rely on
getting water there for long after rain has fallen, as the supplies
are soon exhausted. In January 1908, I heard that water and grass
were extremely abundant, and large numbers of Arabs were encamped
there with their flocks and herds. But when I reached the place at
the end of the next month, most of the grass had been eaten up;
only a few Arabs remained, and these were baling out the last drops
of water from the holes to fill their skins preparatory to
forsaking the place.</p>

<p><a id="c05s27"></a><span class="bold">Wadi Meisah</span>, which
drains the north and east slopes of Hadal Aweib Meisah, the eastern
slopes of Gebel Qidmib, and the mountains of Meis-heit-ar, besides
the lower hills of Titailibab, Tahaqayet, and Eqrun, has a total
length along its main channel (including Wadi Awitla, the central
one of its three main heads) of about seventy-five kilometres, and
enters the sea about latitude 22° 45′.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>Wadi Meisah has
three main heads, called by separate names. The most northerly is
the <span class="bold">Wadi Sarobaiya</span>, draining from between
Gebels Qidmib and Meis-heit-ar; one of the heads of this leads to a
steep pass into Wadi Qidmib. The central head, <span class=
"bold">Wadi Awitla</span>, drains the north slopes of Hadal Aweib
Meisah. The southern head, the <span class="bold">Wadi
Lasewid</span>, drains the eastern slopes of Hadal Aweib Meisah and
the lower hills to the east of it; by ascending its southern
feeders, one can pass easily into the heads of Wadi Baueiwai, while
one of the gullies opening into it from Hadal Aweib Meisah contains
a series of rock basins and a small spring called <span class=
"bold">Megwel Um Edwa</span>, rather difficult of access for
camels, which was yielding fair supplies of water in April
1908.</p>

<p>These three heads, each of which has numerous feeders, join
together in a small plain at the south-east foot of O Shakafa, a
remarkably prominent peak practically isolated from the mountains
near it, and from this point onwards the main drainage channel is
called Wadi Meisah. The little plain where the three head wadis
unite is covered with trees, and has almost the aspect of a park;
it is 455 metres above sea-level. Curving eastward and northward
close round the foot of O Shakafa, Wadi Meisah receives from the
south the <span class="bold">Sarob Kwan</span>, a short and very
broad wadi leading to an easy pass into Wadi Didaut, and then winds
about as a narrow gorge shut in by high hills. Just where it leaves
the foot of O Shakafa, there is a track from the east side of the
wadi over a very easy pass into the head of Wadi Orgem.
<span class="bold">Bir Meisah</span> is a well sunk in the alluvium
of the wadi bed about three kilometres below O Shakafa, and 410
metres above sea-level. When I visited it in March 1908, it was
filled with downwash, and as there was plenty of water in the rock
basins of the mountains further north there was then no necessity
to dig it out. The Arabs say the well is about ten metres deep, and
its water is not so good as that obtainable from the galts, so that
they only open it when the other sources in the neighbourhood are
exhausted. Two gullies entering Wadi Meisah from the east, just
below the well, each contain large galts, called <span class=
"bold">Meis-heit-ar</span>, a short distance up from their mouths;
these were both yielding good and plentiful water supplies in the
spring of 1908. After winding about among the hills for ten
kilometres below the well, Wadi Meisah receives a feeder from the
west having three heads. The northern one, <span class="bold">Akla
Da-Aiyob</span>, is a very sandy<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_148">[148]</span> gully, in fact it is choked by drift sand,
and all the trees in it are dead. The central one, coming westward
from among high hills, is called <span class="bold">Hanqun
Ra-ub</span>, while the southern one, called the <span class=
"bold">Wadi Eqaiyib</span>, is only separated from Meisah at its
head by an easy pass, so that it almost forms a loop of Meisah
itself. To go from Bir Meisah to Bir Um Bishtit, one crosses this
pass into Wadi Eqaiyib, then up Akla Da-aiyob, and over another
easy pass at its head into Wadi Um Bishtit; the total distance
between the two wells by this route is only sixteen kilometres.</p>

<p>In its lower stages Wadi Meisah traverses broad open sandy
spaces between low hills, receiving a number of small feeders from
either side. It curves round to the eastward a little south of the
hills of Eqrun and then courses in a north-easterly direction
across the sandy coast-plain to the sea. In the last stages of its
course its channel is very ill-defined, the drainage spreading over
the plain. The trees, which are fairly abundant in its upper parts,
become fewer as one descends, but its lower portions are not always
entirely barren, for after recent rain short grass springs up in
its broad shallow bed and affords a moderate amount of grazing for
sheep. The slope of the wadi floor just below the well is about ten
metres per kilometre; lower down, the gradient gradually lessens,
and in the last forty kilometres of its course is only a little
over five metres per kilometre.</p>

<p><a id="c05s28"></a><span class="bold">Wadi Kiraf</span>, the
next wadi to enter the sea south of Meisah, is really the terminal
portion of the great <span class="bold">Wadi Di-ib</span>, the name
Kiraf being only applied to the drainage from the point of junction
of the Wad el Qireira with Di-ib to the sea, that is, for a
distance of some thirty-one kilometres up from its mouth. The Wadi
Di-ib is probably the most important and remarkable of all the
seawards draining wadis of the Eastern Desert of Egypt and the
Northern Sudan. I have only seen that terminal portion of its
length which lies in Egypt, that is, north of the 22nd parallel;
but the examinations of that length (the part of it lying within
Egyptian territory, including Kiraf, is some eighty-five
kilometres) is enough to show that the wadi must drain an enormous
basin, for the average slope is the remarkably small one of two
metres per kilometre, and the wadi floor in many places, instead of
being sandy, consists of mud similar to that of the Nile Valley.
According to the “Sudan Handbook,” it rises far to the south,
probably near the 20th parallel, and flows generally northwards, so
that its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span> length
must be well over 300 kilometres. Just before it enters Egypt
proper, there is an expansion in its bed covered with rich alluvial
mud, on which crops of <em>durra</em> are grown; my camels were fed
for some weeks on <em>durra</em> obtained from this source whilst I
was working in the neighbourhood. In the present volume I shall
only deal with that portion of Di-ib and its tributaries which lie
north of the 22nd parallel, describing first the main channel and
afterwards its principal tributaries.</p>

<p>Wadi Di-ib enters Egypt a little west of the 36th meridian, as a
broad sandy drainage channel with many trees. Its bed is here only
170 metres above sea-level. Wadi Di-ib receives two feeders from
the east near the 22nd parallel; the Wadi Shendib,<a id=
"FNanchor_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100" class=
"fnanchor">[100]</a> draining the western flanks of the high
mountain mass of Gebel Shendib, is believed to join Wadi Di-ib a
little south of the frontier, while the Wadi Hareitra, draining the
north-eastern flanks of Gebel Shendib and the western slopes of
Gebel Hanquf, probably enters Di-ib a little north of it. For the
first eighteen kilometres of its course north of 22°, Wadi Di-ib
flows northward over a sandy plain, with low hills and ridges,
their feet often swathed in drift sand, on either side. It then
receives an important tributary from the west, called Wadi el
Qurat, draining the north slopes of Gebel Shiab and the hilly
country between Gebel Mashushenai and Adar Aweib. After receiving
Wadi el Qurat, Wadi Di-ib enters mountainous country, being shut in
for some fifteen kilometres by Adar Aweib on the east and Gebel
Balatitda on the west. In its northerly course here Wadi Di-ib
receives many feeders from the hills, of which two entering from
opposite sides near Bir Meheriqa are of interest. That from the
east is really a drainage channel from the sandy plain south of
Gebel Sul Hamid; but it is choked by huge accumulations of drift
sand so that the drainage never reaches Wadi Di-ib, but accumulates
in a depression called O Harbub, about four kilometres above its
mouth. This channel, though very sandy, is quite a practicable
road, as I found by traversing it on my way to Gebel Elba from Bir
Meheriqa. The feeder from the west, which enters Wadi Di-ib about
one and a half kilometres below Bir Meheriqa, is called
<span class="bold">Wadi Salalob</span>; it drains the north face of
Adar Aweib, and heads in a very steep pass<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_150">[150]</span> into Wadi Wieqwer. I managed to get my
riding camel over this pass only with difficulty when unmounted,
and it is quite impracticable for loaded camels; the rise in the
last kilometre before reaching the top of the pass from the
direction of Wadi Di-ib is over one hundred metres, the summit of
the pass being 315 metres above sea-level.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Bir Meheriqa</span> is a spring situated in
the mouth of a small gully at the foot of Gebel Balatitda, close to
the east side of Wadi Di-ib, and practically on the same level as
the wadi floor (120 metres above sea-level), so that it is
extremely easy of access. The floor of the gully is covered with
conglomerate of recent formation and in this are several holes with
pools of clear water about one metre in diameter by twenty
centimetres deep, which fill as fast as emptied. The water is
rather salt, but is drinkable. The portion of Wadi Di-ib which lies
among the mountains has a floor of sandy mud, with abundance of
trees and plants, among which several gazelles were grazing as I
passed through.</p>

<p>About six kilometres below Bir Meheriqa, Wadi Di-ib is joined
from the west by Wadi Warabeit, which drains a rather large extent
of high hills to the west and cuts through the hills north of Adar
Aweib to reach Wadi Di-ib. This wadi forms the route to Bir Meisah
from Bir Meheriqa <em>via</em> the well known easy passes of Bani
Sana and Sarob Kwan; the total distance is about sixty-five
kilometres.</p>

<p>Soon after receiving Wadi Warabeit, Wadi Di-ib gets into lower
hill country, with great accumulations of drift sand. From near
Gebel Tishushi Tiboki it receives the <span class="bold">Wadi Qumad
Lim</span> from the north-west, and then after passing the
extensive group of low hills of Tishushi it is joined by the Wad el
Qireira, which drains a large area east of Hadal Aweib Meisah.</p>

<p>From its junction with Wad el Qireira to the sea, Wadi Di-ib is
called by the special name of Wadi Kiraf. It is merely an
ill-defined drainage channel coursing north-east across a great
sandy plain for a distance of thirty-one kilometres to the sea,
with only one insignificant feeder, <span class="bold">Halal
Hendiyeb</span>, joining it from the westward close to the dark
little hill called Einiwai. The Wadi Kiraf is almost barren, the
great accumulations of sand about the lower parts of Wadi Di-ib
probably absorbing most of the drainage. But to the west of the
mouth of Kiraf there is quite a dense growth of bushes and trees,
covering a large tract and visible from low hills at considerable
distances. This locality is called <span class="bold">Shekra el
Delam</span>; I did not visit it, but the Arabs say
there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span> is no wadi
there, and it is possibly due to the drainage of Wadi Kiraf running
below the surface of the sandy plain and being dammed back by the
sea. A salt well, called <span class="bold">Bir Adal Deib</span>,
exists close to the shore in the same locality.</p>

<p>Of the <span class="bold">Wadi Shendib</span>, only a few of the
heads are situated in Egypt, Gebel Shendib being a mass of
mountains cut through by the 22nd parallel. Collecting from the
west face of the mountain group, a number of drainage lines unite,
in the lower hills flanking the main mass, to form the main channel
of Wadi Shendib, which courses westward through low hill country a
little south of the 22nd parallel to join Wadi Di-ib. None of the
heads have been surveyed in detail; their position is shown on the
map from the statements of guides combined with the knowledge
gained by triangulating fourteen of the principal peaks and
sketching the mountain forms from a considerable distance. As the
mountain peaks are of great height (the highest peak of Shendib,
marked by an iron beacon, is 1,912 metres above sea) and frequently
wrapped in clouds for days or even weeks together, it is probable
that the heads of Wadi Shendib are very steep and convey
considerable streams at certain seasons.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Wadi Hareitra</span>, which lies just within
Egypt, has likewise only been sketched in from a distance, but
having been approached more closely its course is better known than
that of Wadi Shendib. Its main head is nearly on the frontier, in
longitude 36° 20′, between Gebels Shendib and Hanquf. From its head
it makes a nearly quadrantal turn northward and westward, with a
radius of about ten kilometres, among the mountains from which it
receives tributaries, and then crosses the plain westward, turning
south-west among low dark hills to join Wadi Di-ib after a course
of about forty to forty-five kilometres from its head.</p>

<p>The unnamed drainage channel which is blocked by sand at
<span class="bold">O Harbub</span> before reaching Wadi Di-ib heads
in a tract of low hills with sandy interspaces about thirteen
kilometres west of Gebel Elba; it receives no part, however, of the
drainage of Elba itself, which goes northward by other more
important channels. It is a broad and shallow ill-defined drainage
line across the sandy plain, with very few trees, but its feeders
from the low hill tract of Sul Hamid are less barren. The principal
interest of this drainage line lies in its forming a convenient
direct road from Bir Meheriqa to Bir Akwamtra and<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span> Halaib, being far less sandy,
as well as shorter, than any alternative route round the north side
of Sul Hamid. In using this road, one leaves the drainage line to
the south on the plain, and skirts the hills of Sul Hamid till one
reaches the flat sandy divide at the head of Wadi Eikwan, with the
“Scragged hill” of Qash Amir in view. Here one turns eastward about
four kilometres south of Qash Amir, and follows an easy pass into
Wadi Siamtit, a small feeder of Wadi Yoider, whence tracks lead to
Bir Akwamtra, Bir Kansisrob, and Halaib.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Wadi el Qurat</span>, which joins Wadi Di-ib
from the west in latitude 22° 8′, is a broad wadi with great
abundance of trees. Its main head, which has not been surveyed in
detail, appears to be in Gebel Shiab, about twenty-four kilometres
above its junction with Di-ib, and the first part of its course is
through a rugged tract of low hills. Before reaching Wadi Di-ib it
is joined by the <span class="bold">Wadi Dibir</span>, and Wadi
Hashimaiyib on the north and by <span class="bold">Wadi
Oshqeq</span> on the south. The northern feeders are rather
complex, owing to numerous anastomosings and cross-connexions in
the low hill country between Gebel Mashushenai and Adar Aweib; but
they contain abundance of vegetation and give good grazing grounds.
The short Wadi Dibir heads in <span class="bold">Wadi
Mashushenai</span>, part of the drainage of which it captures. Wadi
Mashushenai is a little wadi to the south of Gebel Mashushenai,
with a well, <span class="bold">Bir Mashushenai</span>, near its
head; part of its drainage goes south to Wadi Dibir as above
mentioned, while the rest continues as Wadi Mashushenai, flowing
south-eastward among low hills for about five kilometres to join
Wadi Hashimaiyib.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Wadi Hashimaiyib</span> heads between Gebel
Warabeit and Gebel Mashushenai. Curving round the north of Gebel
Mashushenai almost in a semicircle, it runs south-south-east among
low hills to join Wadi el Qurat after a course of about sixteen
kilometres. Besides the Wadi Mashushenai above-mentioned,
Hashimaiyib receives, just before entering el Qurat, the
<span class="bold">Wadi Sinqinyeib</span>, which drains part of the
west face of Adar Aweib and the hills west of it, with a length
along its main channel of ten kilometres. There is an easy road up
this wadi, passing close west of Adar Aweib into Wadi Wieqwer, a
tributary of Wadi Warabeit; there is no actual pass, because the
westward drainage of Adar Aweib actually splits, one part going
north by Wadi Wieqwer, and the other south by Wadi Sinqinyeib.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span><span class=
"bold">Wadi Warabeit</span> has its most important head at the easy
and well known pass of <span class="bold">Bani Sana</span>, leading
into Wadi Hamida. It is here a rather wide wadi, with a fairly
rapid fall (about thirteen metres per kilometre), between the high
hills of Gebel Hamida and those forming the south prolongation of
Gebel Geror, and receives numerous feeders from either side. For
the first six kilometres, it runs south-east; it then arrives at a
small open space, where it is joined by eastward drainages from
Gebels Hamida and Warabeit, and turns rather sharply to the
east-north-east. After coursing in this direction for some five
kilometres, it enters another open space, where it receives several
feeders, the principal being the <span class="bold">Wadi
Wieqwer</span>, draining northwards from the hills west of Adar
Aweib. It then receives the <span class="bold">Wadi
Kwileimidaiyeib</span> from the north, and cuts eastward through
the hills to join Wadi Di-ib. The total length of the Wadi Warabeit
from the pass of Bani Sana to Wadi Di-ib is nineteen kilometres,
and in this length it falls from 335 to 113 metres above sea-level,
so that its average slope is nearly twelve metres per kilometre.
Both the wadi itself and its feeders are abundantly supplied with
trees and bushes, while coarse grasses abound in places. Wadi
Warabeit forms a convenient road from Bani Sana to Bir Meheriqa,
being free from sand and well stocked with camel food.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Wad el Qireira</span>, which joins Wadi Di-ib
from the south-west to form Wadi el Kiraf, is really only the
terminal portion of the more important Wadis Didaut and Baueiwai,
which join to the north-east of the conspicuous dark hill mass
called Ti Keferiai. It is a broad shallow drainage line across the
sandy plain, with little vegetation. To the north of it, small
hills are dotted over the plain, the most important being one of
red granite, called Osnei, containing a galt which yields water for
some time after rain. To the south are the low hills of Tishushi,
partly smothered in drift sand.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Wadi Didaut</span>, a feeder of the Wad el
Qireira, commences its course south-west of the hill of Adar
Aqdeib. One of its heads leads to the easy pass of Sarob Kwan, on
the road to Bir Meisah. Another leads to a water source in the
hills south of Adar Aqdeib, called <span class="bold">Megwel
Didaut</span>, while a small feeder a little lower down, coming
from Adar Aqdeib, also contains a water source called <span class=
"bold">Megwel Adar Aqdeib</span>. Both these water sources are
within about half an hour’s journey from the main wadi. After
passing Adar Aqdeib, Wadi Didaut curves<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_154">[154]</span> round to the north, receiving feeders from
the hills of Um Ein and Qara Saba to the south, then turns
east-north-east, passing between the hills called Kikeiyet Sharqi
and Kikeiyet Gharbi, and then between the red granite hills of
Adatalob Adara and the black mass of Ti Keferiai to join Wad el
Qireira. The total length of Wadi Didaut is about thirty-five
kilometres, and its average slope is about eight metres per
kilometre. Its upper parts possess abundance of vegetation, the
beautiful flowering bush called Sarob being conspicuous in Sarob
Kwan; but in its lower portions it becomes almost lost in drift
sand. There is an easy open track from near Megwel Adar Aqdeib,
passing between the high hills called Qara Saba and Gebel Um Ein,
to the Wadi Baueiwai.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Wadi Baueiwai</span> heads in the mountains
south of Hadal Aweib Meisah. Numerous feeders from the mountains
course across a tract, about six kilometres in diameter, of very
low granite hills called Iarih Meisah; this tract is almost
entirely shut in by mountains and high hills, with an outlet
south-west of Gebel Um Ein. Through this outlet the main channel
passes, and receives the <span class="bold">Wadi Miatit</span>,
draining the mountains of the same name, from the south-west.
Curving in a great sweep round the foot of Gebel Um Ein, Wadi
Baueiwai turns north-eastward, passing close south-east of the
hills of Qara Saba and Ti Keferiai to join the Wadi Didaut and form
the Wad el Qireira. From the head of Wadi Baueiwai there appears to
be an easy pass by the east side of Hadal Aweib Meisah into the
heads of Wadi Meisah. A small feeder of Wadi Baueiwai, draining the
north-east flanks of Gebel Um Ein, leads to a water source called
<span class="bold">Megwel Um Ein</span>. Another feeder coming in
from the west side of Qara Saba forms an easy route to Wadi Didaut,
as already mentioned above. The principal other tributaries of Wadi
Baueiwai are the Wadis Aqwem and Hamida. <span class="bold">Wadi
Aqwem</span> is a broad and very sandy wadi coursing
north-north-east along the west side of Gebel Nubitra, and reaching
Wadi Baueiwai in about latitude 22° 18′; it leads to a water source
called <span class="bold">Megwel Aqwem</span>, situated just south
of the end of a long spur of high hills running out north-eastward
from Gebel Miatit. Lower down its course Wadi Aqwem is fed by
tributaries from the high hills east of it, one of which, the
<span class="bold">Wadi Nubitra</span>, contains a well. This well,
called <span class="bold">Bir Nubitra</span>, is said to yield only
very small supplies; it is situated about three kilometres up the
Wadi Nubitra, among high hills. One of<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_155">[155]</span> the many heads of the small Wadi Nubitra
leads northwards by an easy pass into the head of Wadi Hamida.</p>

<p>The <span class="bold">Wadi Hamida</span> heads in the mountain
of the same name, and courses parallel to Wadi Aqwem, from which it
is separated by a long ridge of high hills. About one and a half
kilometres below its head at the easy pass into Wadi Nubitra above
referred to, it receives a small gully from the east; by following
up this gully, which is narrow and tortuous, for about a kilometre,
one can reach a tiny spring called <span class="bold">Megwel
Hamida</span>. When I visited it in April 1908, the spring was a
mere trickle, very salt; a galt a little further up the gorge was
dry at the same time, but bears signs of holding a useful store of
water after rain. About three kilometres below the gully containing
the spring, Wadi Hamida reaches an opening whence one can either go
south-east for two kilometres to the easy pass of Bani Sana, or
north-west through a gap in the longitudinal ridge which encloses
the wadi on the left. Wadi Hamida itself, however, keeps straight
on its course past Gebel Geror, and joins Wadi Baueiwai south-east
of the hill of Ti-Keferiai. The heads of Wadi Hamida contain a fair
amount of vegetation, but its lower parts are more barren and very
sandy.</p>

<p><a id="c05s29"></a><span class="bold">Wadi Di-it</span> drains
the north parts of the hill mass of Sul Hamid, and courses
north-east to reach the coast independently about latitude 22° 29′.
It has not been explored, and is of no great importance; vegetation
in it is probably confined to its upper parts among the hills. Of
its total course of about thirty-five kilometres, a large portion
lies over the sandy coast-plain.</p>

<p><a id="c05s30"></a><span class="bold">Wadi Eikwan</span> is a
broad shallow and sandy channel draining the high jagged hill
called Qash Amir and the eastern parts of the low hill mass of Sul
Hamid. Its head is about four kilometres south of Qash Amir, in the
flat sandy plain. Taking at first a northerly direction past the
west side of Qash Amir, it turns to the north-east further on and
crosses the coast-plain to reach the sea only a little south of the
mouth of Di-it. Its total length is about thirty six kilometres,
and its average slope is about nine metres per kilometre.</p>

<p><a id="c05s31"></a><span class="bold">Wadi Yoider</span>, the
next wadi to the east, is of considerable importance, as it drains
the west portion of Gebel Elba and its heads are extremely rich in
trees and other vegetation, while one of its tributaries contains a
large well of good water (Bir Akwamtra). The main head of Wadi
Yoider may be considered to be the wadi which bears the<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span> special name of <span class=
"bold">Wadi O Sir Hadal</span>, draining the south-west flanks of
Gebel Elba and the north-west flanks of Gebel Hanquf, and heading
in an easy pass close to the well of <span class="bold">Bir Salalat
O Sir</span>, about 450 metres above sea-level. Wadi O Sir Hadal
courses north-west between the mountain ranges for about eight
kilometres, receiving a rather large feeder from the south about
six kilometres below its head. It then emerges from the mountains
and turns north among lower hills, here receiving the <span class=
"bold">Wadi Qeirat</span>, draining westwards from near the summit
of Elba. A few kilometres further on it enters an open plain
sloping rapidly downwards to the north, receiving the small and
narrow <span class="bold">Wadi Siamtit</span> from between two high
hill masses to the west. From here onwards Wadi Yoider courses in
gentle curves a little north of east to reach the coast in about
latitude 22° 27′. A well called <span class="bold">Bir
Nabit</span>, situated in Wadi Yoider, a few hundred metres up from
its mouth, is believed to yield only brackish water. In its journey
to the coast Wadi Yoider receives several feeders from among the
rugged granite hills of El Sela to the west of it, as well as the
important <span class="bold">Wadi Akwamtra</span> from the
north-east flank of Gebel Elba. The head of this Wadi Akwamtra is
quite close to the summit of Elba, and its course is at first
almost due west, afterwards changing to nearly north among the
lower flanking hills, and dividing into two channels which re-unite
lower down. <span class="bold">Bir Akwamtra</span>, one of the best
water sources in the Bisharin country, is situated at an altitude
of 330 metres above sea-level in the eastern channel of Wadi
Akwamtra, about three kilometres up above the place where it leaves
the hills. It is an excavation in the stony floor of the wadi. The
water in April 1908 was about four metres below the wadi floor, and
formed a pool about two metres in diameter in a wide open hollow
which filled as fast as it could be emptied. The water was of
excellent quality. There are two other wells a few hundred metres
further down the same wadi; one of these contained a little water,
while the other was dry, and only the principal well was being
used. The floor of the wadi near and above the well is very stony,
so that it is not a very good camping ground, and the Hamedorab
Arabs pitch their tents of matting further down the wadi. When I
visited the place there were numerous Bisharin Arabs at the well
with their women and children, all busily employed in watering
their flocks and herds and washing their clothes. The wadi, in
spite of its stony floor, is literally full of large trees,
principally acacias, so<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_157">[157]</span> close together that laden camels cannot
pick their way through them for more than a short distance above
the well, and thousands of doves inhabit the trees. There are some
ruins near the wells, built of boulders set in mud; they are said
to have been erected by Dervishes in 1886, when they seized Halaib
and Bir Akwamtra. These Dervishes were killed off by Egyptian
troops, some of them being chased to Bir Meisah and shot there.</p>

<p>As the densely wooded and stony character of Wadi Akwamtra
prevents camels from passing up it much above the well, I found it
necessary, in order to pitch a camp within a reasonable distance of
the summit of Gebel Elba, to descend Wadi Akwamtra for about a
kilometre and to cross the Asut Duk pass leading east into the head
of Wadi Yahameib. This pass is too steep for loaded camels, and
even riding camels have to be led down it; baggage camels have to
go round the hill spurs north of the pass. The head of Wadi
Yahameib is also full of trees and scrub, but it is possible to get
camels up within four kilometres of the summit of Elba by this
route, whereas Bir Akwamtra is over six kilometres from it.</p>

<p><a id="c05s32"></a><span class="bold">Wadi Aideib</span>, with
its principal tributary the Wadi Yahameib, drains the north-east
portion of Gebel Elba and reaches the sea in about latitude 22°
21′. A well, called <span class="bold">Bir Abu Ramad</span>, is
situated in the wadi bed not far from the sea; like that of almost
all the wells close to the coast, its water is probably brackish.
The main head of Wadi Aideib is on the east side of the main peaks
of Elba. Coursing at first north-eastward, this drainage channel
runs through an open sloping plain about one and a half kilometres
wide between the mountain spurs, its channel here dividing into a
great loop with numerous feeders from the ranges on either side.
Passing west of the high isolated granite mass of Karam Elba, it
runs northward over the sloping plain, receiving the Wadi Yahameib
from the west near the low red granite hills called Ti Hamra, and
then courses north of east to the sea.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Wadi Yahameib</span> originates on the
north-west flanks of Gebel Elba, where steep well wooded gorges
unite in a steeply sloping stony plain, covered with trees and
scrub, between two great spurs of the mountain. There is no pass at
its main head, but just before it enters the plain there is a small
feeder from among the hills to the west, by following up which one
can get over a rather steep pass called <span class="bold">Asut
Duk</span>; this pass forms a short cut for unladen camels between
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span> wells of
Kansisrob and Akwamtra, but is too steep for animals loaded with
baggage. Curving round to the east, Wadi Yahameib is fed, just
before it joins Wadi Aideib, by the <span class="bold">Wadis
Akau</span> and <span class="bold">Kansisrob</span>, both draining
the north parts of a great spur of Gebel Elba. Wadi Akau contains a
small spring, called <span class="bold">Megwel Akau</span>, a short
distance above its opening from the hills, while Wadi Kansisrob
contains a great well of good water called <span class="bold">Bir
Kansisrob</span>, a short distance up from its mouth. Bir Kansisrob
is second only to Bir Akwamtra in importance, and there are usually
many Bisharin camps in the wadi just below it. Like all the wadis
draining from Elba, Wadis Yahameib and Aideib are full of trees and
scrub and grasses; in going to the foot of Elba up the head of Wadi
Yahameib with baggage camels, much more difficulty is caused by the
closeness of the trees and scrub than by the stony nature of the
floor. The Elba district is, I believe, the only place in the
Eastern Desert of Egypt where vegetable growth is so abundant as
seriously to hinder one’s caravan in approaching the mountains; for
the progress of baggage camels to be arrested while still four or
five kilometres from a peak by the steep and stony nature of the
ground is common enough; but for the arrest to be due to trees and
scrub was a new and interesting experience. Even the sand dunes on
the west side of Wadi Yahameib are half-covered with coarse
grasses, and look green instead of the usual yellow. When we could
get no further with our camping equipment, Mr. Bakewell, who had
been in South Africa, informed me that we were in what would be
called in that country “open bush”; but in comparison with the rest
of the desert the place was a jungle.</p>

<p><a id="c05s33"></a><span class="bold">Wadi Todhi</span> drains
the high hills about Karam Elba. In the upper part of its course it
flows north-east between Karam Elba and a range of lower granite
hills called Mikeriba; emerging thence on to the plain, its
drainage spreads out over a tract, called <span class="bold">Karam
Hindi</span>, covered with trees, whence part drains to the Wadi
Aideib while another part goes to the sea near Suakin el Qadim.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Suakin el Qadim</span>, is a collection of
mounds close to the sea a little south of latitude 22° 20′. Bent,
who visited the place in 1896, found “nothing earlier than Cufic
remains, unless the graves, formed of four large blocks of
madrepore sunk deep into the ground, may be looked upon as a more
ancient form of sepulture.”<a id="FNanchor_101"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> My native
assistant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span> reported
there was no well at the place, nor anything of interest besides
the graves.</p>

<p><a id="c05s34"></a><span class="bold">Wadi Delowa</span> is a
small wadi entering the sea about six kilometres south-east of
Suakin el Qadim. It originates in the low hill country near
Mikeriba and flows north-east between the little red hill of Alafot
and the low banks called Alafot Onqwab on the north and the granite
hills of Kreishim and Taar Ara on the south.</p>

<p><a id="c05s35"></a><span class="bold">Wadi Serimtai</span> is an
important drainage line, the main head of which is situated in the
Sudan, probably near the great mountain of Asotriba. It enters
Egypt in longitude 36° 22′, coursing northward between Gebel Hanquf
and Gebel Shendodai, from which last-named mountain it receives a
feeder called <span class="bold">Wadi Um Seyal</span>. After
passing Gebel Shendodai it crosses a tract of low granite hills to
the foot of Gebel O Sir Eirab, where it receives the wadi of the
same name and numerous feeders from Gebel Hanquf. It then turns
north-east, passing along the foot of the spurs of Elba, and north
of the granite hills of O Wota and Abai Sis to reach the sea ten
kilometres north-west of Halaib. About twenty-five kilometres up
from its mouth, Wadi Serimtai contains a well called <span class=
"bold">Bir Sararat Serimtai</span>, which has, however, not been
visited. The <span class="bold">Wadi O Sir Eirab</span>, an
important tributary of Serimtai, drains the south flanks of Gebel
Elba, coursing at first south-west and then turning sharply
eastward. At the turn is a well in the wadi floor called
<span class="bold">Bir Salalat O Sir</span>, 440 metres above
sea-level, close to which is an easy pass leading into the head of
Wadi O Sir Hadal, a tributary of Wadi Yoider. From its entry into
Egypt to its mouth, Wadi Serimtai has a length of forty-five
kilometres, and an average slope of twelve and a half metres per
kilometre. It contains plenty of trees and scrub, especially in its
upper parts.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Mera Kwan</span> is a wadi draining
north-eastward from Gebel Shendodai and entering the sea a little
north of Halaib. It has not been surveyed in detail, but as it
drains from high mountains it doubtless contains plenty of
vegetation, especially in its upper parts. The lower half of its
course is rather sandy, passing among low hills on to the
coast-plain.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Halaib</span>, the only permanent village on
the Red Sea coast of Egypt south of Qoseir,<a id=
"FNanchor_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102" class=
"fnanchor">[102]</a> is situated in latitude 22° 13′ 25″ N.,
longitude<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span> 36° 38′
56″ E.<a id="FNanchor_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103" class=
"fnanchor">[103]</a> The name of the place is pronounced locally
Oleiyib, and though I have retained the established European
spelling as given on the charts, none of the natives would
recognise the name if pronounced in its Europeanised form. Its most
conspicuous buildings, and the only ones composed of masonry in any
form, are a fort and a block-house; there are a few rude wooden
shanties, mostly built of timber which has been cast up on the
beach, but the bulk of the population live in little reed huts and
tents of matting. Halaib is the headquarters of a small police
force under the command of a moawen, the men being lodged in the
fort. The fort, which stands about forty metres from the sea on low
ground, is an irregular octagon in plan, about ten metres in
diameter by six and a half metres high. As its top is only eight
metres above the sea and there are low banks west of it, the fort
is not very conspicuous as one approaches it from the landward
side, but being whitewashed and open to the sea it is a good
landmark for sailors in the neighbourhood. It has two flagstaffs,
from which the British and Egyptian flags are flown on Fridays. The
fort is entered by a ladder, the floor forming the police quarters
being about three metres above ground. Below are water tanks, and
above a trap door gives access to the roof, which is carried on
iron rails and plastered over with stucco. The roof vibrates too
much for it to be used as a triangulation station, and observations
here were taken from an eccentric point on the ground and
afterwards reduced to centre. The block-house is a smaller
rectangular structure, whitewashed, situated on a low bank about
400 metres south-west of the fort. A small jetty, built of coral,
runs out from near the fort far enough for a small boat to get
alongside.</p>

<p>There are five wells at Halaib, all within a few hundred metres
of the fort. The water is very hard, and exerts a very strongly
aperient action on those unused to it, though the Arabs of the
place consider it very good. A small Government garden near the
fort contains a few small date palms, but there is no other
cultivation. There is a sort of bazaar, where one can buy clothes,
sugar, dates, fat, etc., but the supplies are small and there was
no flour to be got when I was there. Eggs can be purchased from the
Arabs, who possess a few fowls, and excellent fish can be got very
cheaply from the fishermen. For a daily wage of eight piastres a
fisherman supplied me with as much fresh<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_161">[161]</span> fish daily as I and my men could eat. Sheep
can be got from the hills at a day’s notice, a good fat one costing
L.E. 1. Firewood has to be brought in from the mountains, and any
European making a stay at the place would do well to send to Bir
Kansisrob or Bir Frukit for pure water at the same time. The people
are very friendly, but only a few speak Arabic. There is a
<em>kuttab</em> where boys learn to read and write Arabic under the
tuition of a sheikh from Suakin, so that Arabic may perhaps be more
spoken after another generation.</p>

<p>There are two islands a little north of Halaib, both low and
sandy. The larger one, called <span class="bold">Geziret Halaib el
Kebir</span>, is nearly triangular, with sides about three and a
half kilometres long. It can be reached easily by wading across a
narrow channel in low states of the sea. On it is the grave, marked
by a wooden cross, of Lieut. Stewart, R.N., who lost his life in a
fight with Dervishes here in 1886. The smaller island lies further
north; it is called <span class="bold">Geziret Kwolala</span><a id=
"FNanchor_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104" class=
"fnanchor">[104]</a> on account of its nearly circular shape.</p>

<p>Halaib possesses an excellent harbour, though it is sometimes
difficult of access to sailing vessels owing to the direction of
its entrance.<a id="FNanchor_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105"
class="fnanchor">[105]</a> It is visited occasionally by Coast
Guard cruisers as well as by small trading boats from Suakin. On
enquiry of the local sailors, I found most of the names given on
the Admiralty Charts of this district to be unknown to them. For
example, Abu Dara, Sherm Alueda, Ras Abu Fatma, Elba Island, Ras
Jazriyal, and Cape Elba were all unknown. Abu Dara was called by
the natives Shekra el Delam, while Elba Island was called Geziret
el Dibia, and Cape Elba is locally known as Ras Hadarba. I obtained
the following names for the small anchorages north and south of
Halaib, though I could not locate them exactly on the maps, as the
sailors could not read a map sufficiently well, and the harbours
themselves are mere gaps through the outer coral reef, not visible
indentations of the actual coast-line. Starting from Bir Adal Deib
and going southward, Mersa Abu el Qâsim is near the mouth of Wadi
el Kiraf; a big tree forms a landmark for entering it. Further on
is Mersa Harâba, then Mersa Abu Naam with an island opposite to it,
then, after passing Ras Unbilat, comes Mersa Yoider, at the mouth
of Wadi Yoider, where there is a well called Bir Nabit. Passing
Abu<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span> Ramad well in
Wadi Aideib, and Suakin el Qadim, one comes to Mersa Aqwetit, then
to Mersa Serimtai, at the mouth of Wadi Serimtai, opposite the
island of Kwolala, and then to Mersa Halaib itself. South of Halaib
the principal anchorage is Mersa Shellal, at the mouth of Wadi
Shellal. The cape in latitude 22° 10′ is called Ras Qubet Isa. A
small anchorage south of Ras Hadarba (Cape Elba) appears to be
called indifferently Mersa Hadarba (from the hills near it) or
Mersa Qabatit (from the wadi and well near it); but I could not
make quite sure if these are one and the same, or two separate
anchorages.</p>

<p><a id="c05s36"></a><span class="bold">Wadi Shellal</span> heads
between the high mountain masses of Gebels Shendodai and Shellal,
and courses north-east for about thirty kilometres to reach the
coast about four kilometres south-east of Halaib. In its lower
part, where it crosses the coast-plain, it is a broad shallow
drainage channel full of scrub. Its upper parts, which have not
been explored, are doubtless well supplied with trees, and are
stated to be the principal habitat of the Hamedorab Arabs.</p>

<p><a id="c05s37"></a><span class="bold">Wadi Aqilhoq</span>, which
drains the eastern parts of Gebel Shellal, courses about parallel
to Wadi Shellal a few kilometres further south. It contains a well,
<span class="bold">Bir Frukit</span>, about twenty kilometres up
from its mouth, near some dark conspicuous foot hills called Gebel
Balatitda. This well yields a constant supply of very good water,
and is the place where I sent for my water supplies in commencing
my return march to Port Sudan. The position of the well as shown on
the map is only approximate, but its direction having been pointed
out with the alidade by guides from two plane-table stations, I
believe the location is pretty nearly correct.</p>

<p><a id="c05s38"></a><span class="bold">Wadi Aqwei</span> drains
east of north from among the foot-hills east of Gebel Shellal, and
enters the sea four kilometres west of Ras Qubet Isa. Where I
crossed it two kilometres from its mouth it was a broad shallow
wadi with plenty of scrub, dividing round a low but conspicuous
gravel bank before reaching the sea.</p>

<p><a id="c05s39"></a><span class="bold">Kreit-reit-or</span> is a
similar wadi to that last mentioned, coursing north-eastward over
the plain from among low hills, and entering the sea five
kilometres south-east of Ras Qubet Isa. About two kilometres south
of Kreit-reit-or, at a distance of three and a half kilometres from
the coast, and thirty metres above sea-level, are the bitter wells
of <span class="bold">Ti Kureitra</span>. These are four wells,
sunk about twelve metres deep in the gypseous strata which here
underlie the sand and gravel of the coast-plain.<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span> The wells are lined with slabs
of selenite. The water is so strongly purgative that a number of my
Arabs who drank of it were made extremely unwell, and the wells are
chiefly used for watering the flocks of sheep which graze in the
neighbouring valleys.</p>

<p>From the group of conspicuous though not very high hills called
Gebel Hadarba, ten kilometres west of Ras Hadarba (Cape Elba) many
drainage channels cross the coast-plain towards the sea in a
direction north of east. Some of the drainage lines form the north
side of the hills reach the sea east of Ti Kureitra wells; but
others lose themselves in a quicksand called <span class=
"bold">Kuatianai</span>, or “the devourer,” which covers a large
triangular space of about twenty square kilometres about the cape.
At the actual cape, rocks are visible at the coast, and the
quicksand, so far as I could judge from a distance, appears to be
really a lagoon, filled with the sand washed down from the hills.
The Arabs state that camels wandering on this sand get swallowed
up; the colour of its surface is distinctly darker than the rest of
the plain.</p>

<p><a id="c05s40"></a>On either side of the 22nd parallel, near the
sea are low gravel-covered banks of calcareous grit, seventy metres
high in places, and through these pass several broad wadis draining
from the low hill country further west. The chief of these wadis,
called <span class="bold">Wadi Qabatit</span>, enters the sea at a
well defined inlet of the coast called Mersa Qabatit. A well,
<span class="bold">Bir Qabatit</span>, is situated in the bed of
another drainage channel a little south of the main wadi, one and a
half kilometres south-east of the mersa and 3·85 kilometres south
of the 22nd parallel. The ground at the well is only five metres
above the sea. The well is a big excavation in the wadi floor, and
its water surface is about at sea-level. To me the water tasted
decidedly salt, but the Arabs say it does not purge them.</p>

<p class="nind">while there are numerous more or less isolated
mountains and hills lying outside these principal masses. In the
present chapter a more detailed account will be given of each of
the main groups, taking them in order from north to south, the
principal outlying hill-masses being considered along with the
mountain group to which they are in greatest proximity. It may be
remarked that the geographical positions of all the principal peaks
are tabulated in <a href="#Page_51" class="pginternal">Chapter
III.</a></p>

<h3><a id="c06s01"></a>The Migif — Hafafit — Nugrus — Hangalia —
Zabara Group.</h3>

<p>The highest mountains of the group (<em>see</em> the detailed
map on <a href="#pl06">Plate VI</a>) form a close cluster, round
Gebel Nugrus (1,505 metres) as a centre, between latitudes 24° 40′
and 24° 55′, while other more or less detached masses are scattered
to the north and west. A striking feature of the central cluster is
the tendency to extension in a north-west and south-east direction,
which is specially marked in the Hafafit and Hangalia ranges.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span><span class=
"bold">Gebel Nugrus</span>, the central and highest mountain of
this northerly group, is a great boss of red granite rising to a
height of 1,505 metres among schists and gneisses. It is an almost
isolated mass, for though the Hangalia and Hafafit ranges close in
on it from either side, there are passes both east and west of it
by which a circuit of the mountain can be made. In plan, it is a
pear-shaped mass, about fourteen kilometres in length by six
kilometres in width, having its long axis north-west and
south-east. Gebel Nugrus is on the main watershed; its north parts
are drained Nilewards by the Wadi Hangalia and other feeders of
Wadi Gerf, while the drainage from its south portion passes by the
Wadi Nugrus and Wadai el Nom to the Wadi Gemal and thence to the
sea. The ascent of the mountain was made from a camp about four
kilometres west of the summit, at the top of the pass leading into
the stony head of Wadi Nugrus. The divide here is flat and sandy,
at an altitude of 691 metres above sea-level, so that the ascent
from camp to summit was 814 metres. Striking eastwards over the
lower ridges which flank the main back-bone of the mountain, the
summit was reached after a climb of nearly four hours. When
ascended from this side, there appear to be two main peaks, of
which the further one, marked by a beacon, is the triangulation
point; the best way up is between the two peaks, as the passage
from one to the other is very rough and steep. Though tiring, the
climb is not very difficult. The top of the mountain (<em>see</em>
<a href="#pl07">Plate VII</a>) is a mass of great rounded knobs of
granite, on which a suitable place for setting up instruments was
only found after some searching. The beacon, in latitude 24° 48′
34″, longitude 34° 35′ 47″, is on a rounded eminence not large
enough to receive an instrument, so that eccentric observations
were necessary; the distance between the eccentric point of
observation and the beacon had to be found by a subtense method, as
the roughness of the mountain top rendered any process of chaining
or taping impossible. The view from the summit is very fine. To the
west, one sees the pinnacles of Migif and the nearer long range of
Hafafit; to the north-east is the black cone of Atut; northward,
seen over a sea of hills, is Igli; to the east is the high ridge of
Hangalia, culminating to the south in Gebel Zabara.</p>

<p>The sea is visible to the north-east and east, but the sea
horizon was obscured during the three days I spent on the summit by
banks of clouds. These cloud banks simulated the sea horizon very
closely,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span> their
upper surface appearing perfectly horizontal. They caused a
peculiar phenomenon at sunrise, producing the optical effect of two
suns rising one after the other owing to the refraction through the
cloud. The first thing seen was a blood-red image of the sun rising
over the true sea horizon, which was only thus discovered, the sun
being seen through the cloud; about three minutes later, when a
little more than half the blood-red disc had risen, the true sun
rays flashed out from another and much brighter segment appearing
over the top of the cloud, so that parts of two sun disks were seen
at once, quite separately, one over the other.</p>

<p>Before descending from the mountain, I went along the ridge
south-east and north-west of the highest point to get plane-table
stations; in either direction progress along the top is extremely
difficult. To the north-west it appeared as though the way would be
easier by keeping on the east side of the ridge, but in reality
this was not so, as the slope was so steep and smooth that some
stretches could only be got over by wriggling along with as much as
possible of one’s body in contact with the rock. The descent from
the north-west end of the ridge to camp was difficult and rather
dangerous in places. It is possible that a better way up the
mountain could be found from the pass at the head of Wadi Hangalia,
on the opposite side to where I started; that pass is 120 metres
higher than the west one, so that the total climb would be lessened
by that amount, and the horizontal distance is about the same.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Hafafit</span> is a very long range,
chiefly of gneiss, running in a nearly straight line south-eastward
for over thirty kilometres. Its highest peaks are at its north end,
where they are not very much lower than those of Gebel Nugrus; the
heights decrease gradually further south. Half way down the range
is a very conspicuous peak called <span class="bold">Um
Moghar</span>, 860 metres above sea, while another well marked
summit, the only one which I climbed, exists near the south end and
rises to 744 metres. This last-named point is marked by a beacon,
in latitude 24° 35′ 32″, longitude 34° 45′ 22″. On either side of
the main back-bone of Hafafit are high flanking ridges. The
drainage of Hafafit practically all flows seaward by the Wadi
Gemal; the west faces are drained by Wadi Hafafit, and the east
ones by Wadi Nugrus.</p>

<p>East of the south part of Gebel Hafafit are some remarkable
bosses of granite, of which the chief, Gebel Abu Had, rises to
633<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span> metres above
sea, and is a landmark for Bir Abu Had. Another remarkable hill,
closer in to Hafafit and the Wadi Gemal, is shaped like a bell with
a handle on the top; this hill, which forms a good landmark, is
called <span class="bold">Gebel Um Regeba</span>, and its summit is
571 metres above the sea.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Migif</span> is a very spiky gneiss
mass situated about thirteen kilometres west of Gebel Nugrus. It
has several summits of about equal height, fairly close together,
but separated by deep clefts. The triangulation beacon is on the
western peak, in latitude 24° 47′ 23″, longitude 34° 27′ 30″, 1,199
metres above sea-level. The foliation planes of the rock dip to the
north, and the only safe means of ascent is up the resulting north
slopes. The south aspect is precipitous. When ascending the
mountain, I pitched my camp 2·7 kilometres north of the beacon, in
a gully draining into Wadi Shait, west of another gully containing
the water holes called Galt Um Karaba, at an altitude of 607 metres
above sea-level. The ascent, of 592 metres, took two hours steady
climbing, and was not difficult. I kept on the west side of the
gorge till near the top, and this is the best way up the mountain,
for I found the gorge itself to be steep and abounding in
impassable precipices. The view from Gebel Migif is shut in to the
east by the high masses of Gebels Hafafit and Nugrus; Gebels Atut
and Igli are conspicuous to the north; to the south-east, one
overlooks the great sandy basin of Wadi Hafafit; while to the
south-west is more open country in which the two remarkable cones
of El Nahud, the sharp peak of Gebel Abu Khrug, the ridge of Gebel
Hamrat Selma, and closer in the ranges called Gebel Dweig, are
striking features. On a clear day, the huge mountains of Hamata and
Abu Hamamid, eighty kilometres to the south-south-east, can be
discerned. The photographs on <a href="#pl08">Plate VIII</a> will
give an idea of the views looking towards Gebels Nugrus and Dweig
respectively. In the upper view Gebel Nugrus is seen behind the
Hafafit range; in the lower, the masses close in are Gebel Dweig,
while in the distance, to the right of the centre, is Gebel Hamrat
Selma, and behind it on the horizon the spike of Gebel Abu Khrug.
The precipitous nature of the south side of Gebel Migif is evident
in both views.</p>

<p>The north and west sides of Gebel Migif are drained by the Wadi
Shait, which passes the foot of the mountain; the steep south face
drains into Wadi Dweig, a tributary of Shait; while the eastern
face, flanked by low hills, is drained by Wadi Hafafit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>Gebel Dweig is a
small group of high hills close to the south of Gebel Migif, with
which it combines to form a <em>cul-de-sac</em> round the head of
Wadi Dweig. Gebel Dweig resembles Gebel Migif in character, except
that it is lower; the hill on the south side of the narrow opening
by which Wadi Dweig leaves the <em>cul-de-sac</em> is 864 metres
above sea, and this is believed to be the highest of the group. The
eastern part of the mass is a curiously curved range sweeping round
nearly in a semicircle.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Hamrat Selma</span> is a high ridge
rising from the plain about fifteen kilometres south-west of Gebel
Migif. I did not approach it closely, but fixed the position of its
highest point, which is 761 metres above sea-level, by
triangulation.</p>

<p><span class="bold">El Nahud</span> (the breasts) is the name
given to two very remarkable conical hills of volcanic rock rising
from the plain on the north side of Wadi Natash to the south of
Gebel Hamrat Selma. The two hills are about five kilometres apart,
one being south-east of the other. The north-eastern cone is the
sharper of the two, but they have both the same altitude of 662
metres above the sea and rise about 130 metres above the
surrounding country.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Abu Khrug</span> is a granite hill-mass
with a remarkably sharp high peak, about twenty-five kilometres
south-west of Gebel Migif. The summit, which is surmounted by a
triangulation beacon, in latitude 24° 38′ 57″, longitude 34° 16′
19″, has an altitude of 870 metres above sea-level. Abu Khrug, from
its striking Matterhorn-like shape and its situation in fairly open
country, is a conspicuous landmark for great distances. The Arabs
who were sent to erect the beacon stated that the ascent was very
difficult.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Sufra</span> is a mass of rather
flat-topped high hills, partly of volcanic origin, about eighteen
kilometres west of Abu Khrug, on the north side of Wadi Shait. The
triangulation beacon on the summit is in latitude 24° 38′ 42″,
longitude 34° 4′ 13″, at a height of 690 metres above sea-level,
and 340 metres above the well of Um Gubur, which is in the Wadi
Shait about three kilometres to the south-east.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebels Nazla</span> and <span class="bold">Um
Serg</span> are moderately high hills lying to the south of Gebels
Sufra and Abu Khrug, between the Wadis Shait and Natash.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gorf el Natash</span> is a syenite hill on
the south side of Wadi Natash, about five kilometres south-west of
Bir Masur, while <span class="bold">Gebels
Muktil</span><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span> (470
metres), <span class="bold">Derera</span>, and <span class=
"bold">Um Goraf</span>, are prominent hills lying still further
south near Wadi Antar.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Ras Shait</span> is a group of high
rugged-looking reddish hills, probably of granite, at the head of
Wadi Shait, near Gebels Nugrus and Migif. Its highest peak rises to
1,019 metres above sea. The west face drains directly into Shait,
while the eastern and northern slopes drain into Wadi Gerf, which
joins Shait far to the south-west. Between Gebels Migif and Ras
Shait is a small range of hills dividing Wadi Shait from the head
of Wadi Hafafit; across the south end of this range, which is
composed of dark schists with white granite at its western foot,
there runs a zigzag pass, fairly easy for camels, to the head of
Wadi Nugrus.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Mudergeg</span> is a high range of
reddish hills, which with Gebels Ras Shait and Migif encloses the
heads of Wadi Shait. Its highest point is 1,086 metres above sea.
To the east of it are several other lower ranges, some of white and
others of black aspect, which have not been approached closely.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Hangalia</span> is a great mountain
ridge running south-south-east for about twelve kilometres, from
Gebel Ghuel to Gebel Zabara, consisting chiefly of schists. Its
highest peak is 1,241 metres above sea-level. Its western faces are
drained partly to the Nile by the Wadi Hangalia (a tributary of
Wadi Gerf) and partly to the sea by the Wadai el Nom (a tributary
of Wadi Nugrus); its eastern faces, which are flanked by high
ridges, drain into the various feeders of Wadi Ghadir.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Zabara</span>, a mountain mass rising
to 1,361 metres above sea-level, forms a southward extension of the
Hangalia range. The cairn on its summit is in latitude 24° 45′ 21″,
longitude 34° 41′ 53″. The mountain is drained on the north and
east sides by feeders of the Wadi Ghadir, while its western flanks
are partly drained by the Wadai el Nom. Gebel Zabara is chiefly
composed of schists of various types. The ancient emerald mines of
Zabara are in the north-east part of the mountain, about two and a
half kilometres from its summit. A triangulation beacon marks the
highest point of the mountain, but this was only used as an
intersection point. I ascended some of the flanking ridges near the
old mines; these consisted of splintery schists, and though the
climbing is steep and rough (<em>see</em> <a href="#pl09">Plate
IX</a>), the schists give a good foothold so that the ascent to the
top is probably not very difficult.<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_170">[170]</span> The ruins in the Wadi Zabara, near the old
mines, are at 514 metres above sea-level; the climb from them to
the summit is thus one of 857 metres. Due south of Gebel Zabara is
a high ridge, the north-west end of which is 1,104 metres above
sea-level; this ridge is the most conspicuous of a mass of high
hills flanking Gebel Zabara to the south, which have not been seen
except from a distance, but which are probably drained by the Wadi
Nugrus.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Ghuel</span>, which forms a northward
extension of Gebel Hangalia, is likewise composed of schists. Its
highest point, the south end of a conspicuous high ridge, is 1,104
metres above sea. Its eastern faces are drained by the Wadis Ghuel
and Fegas, both tributaries of Wadi Ghadir, while its western
flanks drain into the heads of Wadi Um Khariga. High hills flank
the main ridge on both sides, especially the east, and through
these the drainage channels form deep gloomy gorges. Wadi Ghuel
contains important water holes.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Um Khariga</span> is the name given to
several high hill ranges on either side of the Wadi Um Khariga. Two
of these ranges, one on either side of the upper part of the wadi,
form like Gebel Ghuel north extensions of the high ridge of
Hangalia; the western range can be crossed at a gap by an easy
pass, 773 metres above sea-level, which separates the heads of Wadi
Gerf from those of Wadi Um Khariga. These two ranges shut in the
wadi on either side for some ten kilometres of its northward
course, beyond which the country becomes more open and the wadi
curves round to the north-east, passing the north end of a third
range of high hills which is likewise called Gebel Um Khariga. This
third range extends northward for about ten kilometres from Gebel
Ghuel, from which it is separated by a pass forming a good road
over the head of Wadi Ghadir. Its most conspicuous feature is a
twin peak at its north end, 674 metres above sea-level. The main
ridge is flanked by high hills, especially on the east side. Only
the north and west flanks of this range are drained by Wadi Um
Khariga, the eastern side being cut up by feeders of Wadi Sukari.
Besides the pass separating it from Gebel Ghuel, there are two
other passes, one round its north end into Wadi Sukari, and another
at its south end between Wadi Ghadir and Wadi Sukari, so that a
complete circuit of this range can be made by camels. Some of the
hills composing the mass consist of highly magnetic schists, and
compass readings in the region may be disturbed by many
degrees.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span><span class=
"bold">Gebel Igli el Iswid</span> is a rather rugged mountain mass
rising among a sea of lower hills, thirty kilometres north of Gebel
Nugrus. Its highest point, marked by a triangulation beacon, in
latitude 25° 4′ 6″, longitude 34° 36′ 16″, is 975 metres above
sea-level. The mountain forms a tripartite watershed between the
basins of Wadi Um Khariga (draining the south slopes), Wadi Dabur
(draining the north and west slopes), and Wadi Igli (draining the
eastern face), each of which three wadis courses separately to the
sea. In occupying the triangulation station on the summit, I placed
my camp in a gully draining to Wadi Um Khariga, about two
kilometres south-south-west of the summit at an altitude of 605
metres above sea. The climb of 370 metres to the top from this camp
was not difficult, and occupied only a little over an hour and a
half. The mountain consists of very hard grey siliceous rocks,
which ring under the hammer, and are probably crushed and
devitrified felsites (<em>see</em> <a href="#Page_281" class=
"pginternal">p. 281</a>). There are galts in some of the gullies
draining from this mountain, hence it is sometimes called <em>Igli
el Rayani</em>. At the time of my visit (December 1905) there was
said to be a little water in a galt on the west side of the mass;
but the rock basins in the gully which I ascended were empty.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Igli el Ahmar</span>, sometimes called
<em>El Atshani</em>, is a lower hill mass of granite some ten
kilometres north-east of Igli el Iswid.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Atut</span> is a high black conical
hill thirty kilometres north-west of Gebel Nugrus. Rising
considerably above the hills which immediately surround it, Atut is
visible from a great distance from the west, and its conical form
renders it easy of recognition. Its summit, marked by a beacon, in
latitude 25° 0′ 56″, longitude 34° 23′ 49″, is 908 metres above
sea-level and 300 metres above the branches of the Rod el Atut
which encircle its base. A camp can be placed close to the foot of
the cone, and the ascent is easily made in about an hour. The rock
of Gebel Atut is olivine gabbro (<em>see</em> <a href="#Page_302"
class="pginternal">p. 302</a>), of great hardness, and the whole
surface of the mountain is formed of great blocks, rounded and
boulder-like below, but angular higher up. The blocks have
rusty-looking surfaces, but are perfectly sound rock inside, and
they ring like bells under the hammer. The upper illustration on
<a href="#pl10a">Plate X</a> shows a view of the summit of Gebel
Atut, from which its blocky nature will be evident. The view from
Gebel Atut is a very extensive one. To the west and north
(<em>see</em> the lower illustration on <a href="#pl10b">Plate
X</a>) one can see the peaks of Gebels Muelih, Haggar
Dungash,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span> Iteima,
Abu Diab, and Hamrat Wogud; to the south-east are the masses of
Migif and Nugrus, while eastward one looks over a great expanse of
hills towards Gebels Dabur and Um Khariga, with the sea beyond.</p>

<p>The hills of <span class="bold">Um el Huetat</span>, the highest
of which rise over 200 metres above the wadis round them, are
situated about eight kilometres due west of Gebel Atut; they are
composed of schists of various types, and contain some old mines,
mostly in talc schist. They are drained by the Rod el Farag, a
tributary of Wadi Gerf.</p>

<p>On the other side of the Rod el Farag, <em>i.e.</em>, further
west of Gebel Atut, are numerous scattered hills, the higher of
which bear the names of <span class="bold">Hamrat Mastura</span>,
<span class="bold">El Hamra</span>, and <span class="bold">Um
Himar</span>. These are of granite, gneiss, and schists, with some
coarse gabbro and numerous quartz veins.</p>

<p>Still further west is the remarkable ridge called <span class=
"bold">Erf el Fahid</span>, a great quartz vein ten metres wide and
two kilometres long, rising nearly one hundred metres above the
Wadi Muelih. A beacon on its highest point, 579 metres above
sea-level, marks the triangulation station, its position being
latitude 25° 0′ 5″, longitude 34° 11′ 52″. South-east of Erf el
Fahid is a line of similar but smaller ridges, also formed of great
quartz veins rising through diorites and schists. Still further
down the Wadi Muelih is a curious horse-shoe-shaped hill of aplite,
called <span class="bold">Marwot Rod el Ligaia</span>, round which
the hills of crushed diorite are penetrated with a network of
quartz veins running in various directions.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Muelih</span> is a great boss of white
granite situated close to the north side of Wadi Muelih in
longitude 34°. Its summit, marked by a beacon, in latitude 24° 52′
44″, longitude 34° 0′ 37″, is 707 metres above sea and 350 metres
above the wadi which courses round its south flank, and from which
it is easily climbed. The upper view on <a href="#pl11">Plate
XI</a> gives an idea of its appearance as seen from the base line
camp in the wadi six kilometres east of it.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Hagar Dungash</span> is a great mass of
high hills situated north of Gebel Muelih. The beacon on its
highest point, in latitude 24° 59′ 12″, longitude 34° 2′ 33″, is
815 metres above sea-level. In the hills which flank the main mass
are numerous sharp peaks, one of the most conspicuous of which,
eight and a half kilometres south-west of the beacon, is called
<span class="bold">Gebel Um Dalalil</span>. A ridge five kilometres
due east<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span> of the
beacon bears the name of <span class="bold">Erf Rod Um
Rashid</span>. The rocks of Haggar Dungash are chiefly dark
schists.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Iteima</span> is a group of high
granite hills rising from the plain fifteen kilometres north of Erf
el Fahid. Its highest peak is 849 metres above the sea. It is
drained southwards by the Wadi Muelih.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Hamrat Wogud</span>, which is likewise
of granite, is a higher mountain mass fifteen kilometres east of
Iteima. Its highest point, marked by a beacon, is in latitude 25°
9′ 34″, longitude 34° 20′ 0″, and 1,103 metres above sea. It is
drained southwards by the Rod Um el Farag, a tributary of Wadi
Gerf.</p>

<p>Between Gebels Muelih and Mudergeg is a sandy plain with low
hills, the more conspicuous of which bear special names; among them
are <span class="bold">Marwot Rod el Ligah</span>, <span class=
"bold">Erf Sagur</span>, and <span class="bold">Khusa el
Faraon</span>, the last-named being a group of small but very
remarkable black hills eleven kilometres due south of Erf el Fahid.
Marwot Rod el Ligah is a triangulation point; its beacon is 514
metres above sea-level.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Sukari</span> is a very craggy high
ridge of granitic rock twenty-two kilometres north of Gebel Zabara.
Its highest point, which is at its north end, is 630 metres above
sea-level, but the triangulation beacon was erected on a lower part
of the ridge further south, in latitude 24° 56′ 50″, longitude 34°
42′ 50″, at an altitude of 476 metres, in order to be near to the
extensive old mines and ruins which exist in the locality. Gebel
Sukari is drained by various feeders of Wadi Sukari.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Kurdeman</span> is the name of a low hilly
district on the east side of Wadi Ghadir, thirteen kilometres north
of Gebel Zabara. It is interesting as containing some ancient
mines, doubtless worked for gold. A triangulation beacon has been
erected on a hill just above the workings, in latitude 24° 52′ 35″,
longitude 34° 41′ 35″, at an altitude of 526 metres above sea, or
about fifty metres above the wadi.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Sabahia</span> is a craggy felsite hill
five kilometres south-east of Kurdeman, rising to 520 metres above
sea, or about ninety metres above the wadi. It is drained by the
Wadi Sabahia, a tributary of Wadi Ghadir. In the heads of the Wadi
Sabahia, north-east of the hill, are some old gold mines.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Um Tundeba</span> is a high granite
hill near the head of Wadi Um Tundeba. Its summit is 550 metres
above the sea. It forms<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_174">[174]</span> a landmark for the water hole called Galt
Um Tundeba, which is situated in a small gully, three kilometres
west of the summit of the hill.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Amba-ut</span>, seven kilometres south
of the foregoing, is likewise believed to be of granite; the
southern hill of this group is of a red colour and very conspicuous
as one passes from Um Tundeba to Ghadir.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Ghadir</span>, the summit of which, in
latitude 24° 50′ 9″, longitude 34° 47′ 22″, and 636 metres above
sea, is marked by a triangulation beacon, is thirteen kilometres
north-east of Gebel Zabara. I ascended it from a camp 424 metres
above sea-level in one of the gullies draining westward to Wadi
Ghadir. The ascent is easy. The rocks are greenish serpentines and
ophicalcites below, with a white quartz felsite above.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Allawi</span>, situated on the south
side of the Wadi Allawi, is a diorite hill rising to 515 metres
above sea. It is best approached by ascending a small feeder of
Wadi Allawi, in which a camp can be placed within a kilometre of
the summit and 160 metres below it. There are some interesting old
gold mines in the quartz veins just below the beacon on the summit
of the hill, and a band of graphitic schist crops out near the
north foot of the hill. The position of the beacon is latitude 24°
46′ 42″, longitude 34° 49′ 39″.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Lewewi</span> is a dark craggy hill
range eight kilometres east-south-east of Gebel Zabara, between
Wadi Allawi and its tributary Wadi Lewewi. Its highest point,
marked by a cairn, is 654 metres above sea-level. There are some
old mines in the lower hills two and half kilometres south-east of
Gebel Lewewi, and others a little further off in the same
direction.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Sikait</span> is a rugged ridge of
schists and serpentine situated in the midst of hilly country
fourteen kilometres south-east of Gebel Zabara. The triangulation
beacon which marks its summit is in latitude 24° 39′ 55″, longitude
34° 48′ 5″, and 771 metres above sea-level, and 330 metres above
the wadi which skirts its western foot. Gebel Sikait is of interest
from the abundant ruins and old emerald mines which exist near it,
as well as from the variety of minerals present in its rocks. It is
the Sicily of the Eastern Desert. Beryl, tourmaline, actinolite,
various micas, chlorite, talc and crystals of calcite are amongst
the commoner minerals found. The serpentine<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_175">[175]</span> which abounds in its upper parts is
highly magnetic, and the compass was found to be disturbed by no
less than 40° near the triangulation point. Gebel Sikait is drained
from the west by the Wadi Sikait, a tributary of Wadi Nugrus, and
from the east by the Wadi Um Gamil. The best place to climb it from
is the Wadi Sikait, and the ascent, not a difficult one, is
rendered interesting by the ruins and old mines encountered; part
of the way one passes over an ancient made road, now broken in many
places by the downwash from the hill.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Ras Um Gamil</span> and <span class=
"bold">Gebel Um Gamil</span> are two high hill ranges south-east of
Sikait, which have only been sketched from a distance.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Madaret Um Gamil</span> is a conspicuous
double-topped hill on the north side of the Wadi Gemal, seventeen
kilometres south-east of Sikait. The beacon which marks its highest
point is in latitude 24° 34′ 52″, longitude 34° 56′ 28″, and 454
metres above sea. It is best ascended by a very winding tributary
of the Wadi Gemal; this gully, up which there is a road, leads past
the south-west foot of the hill, and the climb is only one of some
200 metres. The rocks round Madaret Um Gamil are mostly schists,
but the top of the hill is a hard gabbro like that of Gebel Atut,
weathered into rusty looking blocks. A good view seawards is
obtained from the summit, some very red granite forming a
conspicuous feature in the low hills between it and the coast.</p>

<h3><a id="c06s02"></a>The Abu Hamamid — Hamata — Abu Gurdi
Group.</h3>

<p>This group of mountains is remarkable both for its extent and
for the loftiness of many of its peaks, some of which are among the
highest in Egypt. It is a mass of rugged ridges and peaks, covering
about a quarter of a square degree of the earth’s surface between
latitudes 24° 0′ and 24° 30′, in which the two dominant summits,
Abu Hamamid (1,747 metres) and Hamata (1,978 metres) are the most
conspicuous features in the west and east portions respectively,
while Abu Gurdi (1,562 metres) forms the great terminal peak of a
south-easterly extension of the mass. <a href="#pl12">Plate XII</a>
shows two typical views in this rugged region.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Abu Hamamid</span> is a great ridge of
hard greenish schists towering above the surrounding mountains to a
height of 1,747 metres<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_176">[176]</span> above sea. Its crest is broken into a
number of separate summits, which appear from most aspects of
almost a sugar loaf form; the beacon is on the most northerly and
highest of these, its position being latitude 24° 14′ 41″,
longitude 34° 47′ 38″. The mountain is best ascended from the Wadi
Um Semiuki, a tributary of Huluz, which drains its north-east face.
By ascending this wadi till camels could go no higher owing to its
increasingly rough and stony floor, I was able to pitch a camp at
865 metres above sea-level and two and a quarter kilometres
north-east of the summit, leaving an ascent of 882 metres to be
made on foot. The ascent, which occupied four hours, was free from
difficulty till within about one hundred metres of the top, but the
last portion was extremely steep and was only negotiated with
considerable trouble; it represents pretty nearly the limit of
possibility in getting instruments up difficult places. Once the
top was reached, however, the magnificence of the view obtainable,
and the excellence of the point as a station for triangulating the
principal peaks among the thousands visible, seemed an ample
recompense for the trouble of reaching it. The top of the ridge
(<em>see</em> <a href="#pl07">Plate VII,</a> p. 166) is very rough
and narrow, only a little over a metre wide, and it is difficult to
find a spot near the summit where one can spread one’s blankets for
the night with even a slight approach to comfort. The eight nights
of enforced bivouacking which I was obliged to spend on the top of
Abu Hamamid in February 1906, before I could complete my
observations, belong to the least pleasant of my experiences in the
desert. A little work only was possible the first day, owing to
haze obscuring the more distant peaks. On the second day clouds
enveloped us in a wet drizzle, and a bitterly cold north wind blew
with great violence; a rude rubble shelter which my men built on
the summit, covered with a blanket, was a very poor protection, and
I found it better to throw a rubble embankment across a steep gully
on the lee side, forming a small level platform where we were
sheltered from the biting wind. For the next five days, we were
alternately wrapped in clouds or left free under a brilliant blue
sky with clouds covering all the surrounding country. It was
curious on these days to look over the surface of the clouds, as
over a boundless level sea, with only the highest peaks projecting
sharp and black above the white surface, and to see the sun rise
and set exactly as though one were on the ocean. Then at last the
clouds began to disappear, and<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_177">[177]</span> on the first clear day a very large amount
of triangulation was accomplished, all the more prominent peaks
within a radius of about sixty kilometres being observed. Gebel Abu
Hamamid forms a culminating point on the Nile — Red Sea watershed,
its eastern parts draining to Wadi Huluz and its western ones to
Wadi Abu Hamamid, a tributary of Wadi Kharit.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Um Semiuki</span> is a sharp cone
rising to 1,283 metres above the sea among a mass of lower hills
three kilometres north-east of Gebel Abu Hamamid. It is of a
reddish aspect, due to a film which covers the weathered surface of
the green and grey hornfels of which it is composed. It is drained
by the Wadi Um Semiuki.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Abu Argub</span> is a very conspicuous
mountain, almost conical in shape, seven and a half kilometres
south-south-west of Gebel Abu Hamamid, from which it is separated
by lower hills. To the south, Gebel Abu Argub overlooks the plain
of Selaia. Its peak, 1,690 metres above sea-level, is a good
landmark from the south and west.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Kahfa</span> is a many-peaked mountain
of granite rising abruptly to a height of 1,018 metres above sea
from among lower hills of dark schists, nineteen kilometres
south-west of Gebel Abu Hamamid. It is detached from the main
mountain-mass, being separated from it by the heads of Wadi Um
Retba. Its faces are in many places sheer precipices of several
hundred metres (<em>see</em> <a href="#pl13">Plate XIII</a>), but
the ascent of it from the north is not very difficult. In occupying
Kahfa as a station I approached it from Bir Shadli by a well-marked
track which skirts the western foot-hills and leads to the Wadi
Helie. Leaving this track where it crosses Wadi Um Hargal some six
kilometres from Bir Shadli, I ascended the Wadi Um Hargal and
crossed the pass at its head into the head of Wadi Um Retba, where
I pitched my camp at an altitude of 563 metres, at the foot of
Gebel Kahfa 1·3 kilometres north-north-east of the beacon on its
summit. The climb of 455 metres from this camp to the top occupied
three hours. There is good bivouacking ground close east of the
summit, between two ridges. The beacon which marks the
triangulation point is in latitude 24° 8′ 18″, longitude 34° 38′
55″. A walk round the top is full of interest; one can reach many
points overlooking tremendous precipices, and the forms assumed by
the granite peaks are very remarkable. On the west side of the
mountain is a rather<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_178">[178]</span> large open space forming the head of Wadi
Helie, but elsewhere one is surrounded by low hills. The principal
drainers of Kahfa are the Wadis Um Hargal and Um Retba (tributaries
of Wadi el Sheikh) to the north, and Helie and Abu Hashim
(tributaries of Wadi Kharit) to the south.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Medsus</span> is a small group of high
hills rising among lower ones between Gebel Abu Hamamid and Bir
Shadli.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Metawit</span> is a high granite hill
rising conspicuously among much lower hills thirteen kilometres
north-west of Bir Shadli. A track leading from Bir Shadli to Bir
Metawit and other wells further north-west passes close east of the
hill. Gebel Metawit is a good landmark for Bir Metawit, which is
situated in the wadi of the same name about three kilometres
north-west of it. The summit is 741 metres above sea-level or about
295 metres above the wadi floor at the well.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Hamrat Mukbud</span> is a great red
granite mass rising from the plain about twenty-five kilometres
west of Bir Shadli. Its isolated character and great altitude (892
metres above the sea and about 450 metres above the surrounding
country) render Hamrat Mukbud one of the finest and best known
landmarks in this part of the desert. A cairn on its summit marks
the triangulation point, in latitude 24° 9′ 53″, longitude 34° 23′
17″. Its ascent is a matter of some difficulty, owing to its great
steepness.</p>

<p><span class="bold">El Hamra</span> is another red granite mass,
much smaller than Hamrat Mukbud, lying about half-way between that
mountain and Bir Shadli, and separating the Wadi Abu Hamamid from
the Wadi el Sheikh.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Homr Akarim</span> is a hill about
thirty-three kilometres west of Gebel Hamrat Mukbud, close to the
north of Wadi el Khashab. Its summit, 490 metres above sea, is
marked by a triangulation cairn.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Marasan</span> is a range of mountains
north-west of Abu Hamamid. It is cut through by an important pass
over the main watershed, 685 metres above sea-level, connecting the
Wadis Huluz and Abu Hamamid by their respective tributaries Marasan
and Marasani, which drain north-east and south-west from the pass.
The highest peak of the mountains south of the pass is 1,261 metres
above sea-level, while those to the north are lower. The name Gebel
Marasan is, however, commonly given only to the peaks north of the
pass, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span> they rise
more abruptly from it, while those to the south are unnamed or
regarded as part of Gebel Hamamid because the Wadi Abu Hamamid
drains their southern flanks.</p>

<p class="space-above2"><span class="bold">Gebel Khulla</span> is a
range lying a few kilometres west of Gebel Marasan from which it is
quite separated. Its highest point is 978 metres above sea. It is
drained by Wadi Khulla, a tributary of Wadi Abu Hamamid.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Um Sedri</span> is a remarkable pair of
twin peaks on or near the main watershed seventeen kilometres
north-west of Gebel Abu Hamamid, and a little to the south of the
Wadi Huluz. These peaks, which are 970 metres above sea-level and
about 460 metres above the floor of Wadi Huluz, are very
conspicuous from the surrounding high country, but they cannot be
seen from the Wadi Huluz itself as they lie a little way back from
the scarps which bound the gorge. It is the drainage from the hills
round Gebel Um Sedri which feeds the water holes of Um Gerifat, in
a little gorge opening to Wadi Huluz about two kilometres
north-west of the peaks.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel el Heda</span> is a conspicuous hill
situated ten kilometres north-north-west of Gebel Metawit, between
the Wadis Antar and Khashab. Its highest point is 862 metres above
sea-level.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Nukheira</span> is a group of high
hills on or near the main watershed, close to the head of Wadi
Antar and about ten kilometres north-north-west of Gebel el Heda.
Its highest point is 876 metres above the sea.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Ras Abu Etl</span> is a lower hill
seven kilometres north-east of Gebel Nukheira. As seen from the
upper part of the Wadi Gemal it appeared to have a flat top, which
is 648 metres above the sea. It is probably drained by the short
Wadi Abu Etl, which joins Wadi Huluz to form the Wadi Gemal.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Um Suerab</span> is a great high ridge
of dark looking rocks, surrounded by high flanking hills, rising
conspicuously in the hilly country between the Wadis Huluz and
Gemal, about twenty-four kilometres north-north-west of Gebel Abu
Hamamid. The top of its ridge, which appears to be nearly level for
about a kilometre of its length, is 1,024 metres above sea-level.
From its neighbourhood drain two wadis in opposite directions; one,
called the Wadi Um Suerab lil Gemal, goes northward to join Wadi
Gemal, while the other, called Wadi Um Suerab lil Huluz, is the
longer and courses southward to join Wadi Huluz.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span><span class=
"bold">Gebel Durunkat</span> is another apparently flat-topped hill
eight kilometres south-east of Gebel Um Suerab, on the west side of
the Wadi Durunkat, about thirteen kilometres above its junction
with Wadi Gemal. Its summit is 924 metres above sea-level.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Abarun</span> is a mountain range
situated a short distance north-east of Gebel Abu Argub, from which
it is separated by the Wadi Abarun. Its highest peak, almost due
east of that of Abu Argub, from which it is separated by the Wadi
Abarun, is 1,602 metres above sea, and overlooks the great plain of
Selaia to the south.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Um el Tiur</span> is a range extending
south-east from Gebel Abarun, forming a southward prolongation of
the mountains. Its highest peak is 1,450 metres above the sea,
while the terminal peak southward is 1,080 metres. It is drained on
the west by the Wadis el Shel and el Anbat (tributaries of Wadi
Kharit) and on the east by the Wadi Um el Tiur (a tributary of Wadi
Hilgit lil Kharit).</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel el Anbat</span> is a group of lower
dark coloured hills forming the south foot hills of Gebel Um el
Tiur. Its highest point is 788 metres above sea, while a detached
black hill a little west of it on the plain rises to 680 metres
above sea, or 175 metres above the plain at its base. These hills
are drained by the Wadi el Anbat and other small feeders of Wadi
Kharit.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Um Usher</span> and <span class=
"bold">Um Hasidok</span> are conspicuous peaks on the main
watershed ten kilometres east, and twelve and a half kilometres
east-south-east respectively of Gebel Abu Hamamid, rising to 1,487
and 1,497 metres above sea-level. They are drained to the south by
the Wadi Hilgit lil Kharit, and to the north by the Wadi el Mahali,
a feeder of Wadi Huluz.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel el Mahali</span> is a rather high peak
of grey porphyry which forms a northerly extension of Gebel Um
Usher, close south of the Wadi Huluz. Its top is 1,112 metres above
sea, or 330 metres above the adjacent wadi floor.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Hamata</span>, with one exception<a id=
"FNanchor_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106" class=
"fnanchor">[106]</a> the highest mountain in the Eastern Desert of
Egypt, is situated on the meridian of 35°, in latitude 24° 12′,
thirty-three kilometres from the nearest point of the<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span> coast and 213 kilometres from
the nearest point of the Nile, and rises to an altitude of 1,978
metres above sea-level; the summit is marked by a triangulation
beacon, the position of which is latitude 24° 12′ 17″, longitude
35° 0′ 16″. Gebel Hamata lies some five kilometres east of the main
watershed, which curiously enough is not always formed by the
highest peaks. It is drained principally by the Wadi Huluz, the
heads of which almost encircle it. The Wadi Hamata heads in the
eastern face of the high ridge which connects Gebels Hamata and Abu
Ghusun, and thus only takes a small portion of the drainage of
Gebel Hamata itself. Though surrounded by other high mountains,
Hamata towers above them so as to be a very conspicuous feature on
the sky line from great distances. Looked at from the north or
south, it is like a great, rather flat, cone with a smaller cone
east of it. The best way to ascend the mountain is from the head of
the Wadi el Abiad, that feeder of Wadi Huluz which drains the north
face of it. In proceeding up the Wadi el Abiad from Wadi Huluz, one
is shut in by high hills on either side till about six kilometres
from the mountain; then the wadi opens into a rough plain with low
granite hills, and the imposing mass of Hamata springs suddenly
into full view. My camels were coaxed on with their loads up this
wadi, which becomes very steep and stony as its head is approached,
to within two and a quarter kilometres of the summit, where they
actually reached an altitude of 1,025 metres above the sea. The
ascent of the remaining 953 metres on foot, though tiring, was
fairly easy, and occupied less than four hours. The lower third of
Hamata is a whitish granite; this gives place higher up to a hard
quartz felsite, which rings under the hammer and weathers into
rusty brown blocks. To the east of the main summit the rock changes
to a green breccia, which seems to form a considerable portion of
that part of the mountain. The view from the summit is a fine one
in clear weather, including as it does an extensive prospect of the
rugged mountains around, and a large extent of coast-line. But it
was on this mountain that I had my first experience of the chronic
haze which seems to hang almost perpetually over the coastal
regions in the neighbourhood of the tropic, and which is the
greatest enemy of the surveyor in these parts. On each of the three
days which I spent on Hamata, the morning sun rose over cloud-banks
to the east; clouds filled all the wadis and covered the lower
country, while the highest peaks<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_182">[182]</span> stood up clear and sharp above the sea of
cloud. Towards 10 a.m., the clouds gradually melted away over the
land under the increasing solar influence, but there remained a
continuous haze, especially over the coast and out to sea. The
explanation of the almost perpetual clouds and haze was soon seen,
and is very simple. If the wind blows from the north-west, it is
generally cool or even cold in winter. If this north wind is dry
and persistent, the air is clear; but should it fail and warm moist
breezes set in from seaward, these drop their moisture on reaching
the cooler air of the mountains. If the air is still or nearly so,
the moisture is evaporated in the sun’s rays during the day, only
to precipitate itself again as the air cools by rapid radiation at
night. As a consequence, dews on the mountains are extremely heavy,
and one soon learns to seek the shelter of an overhanging rock or
to improvise a rude tent from a blanket and a few sticks over one’s
nightly resting-place.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Abu Ghusun</span> is a mountain range
north of Hamata, with which it is connected by a ridge of lower
peaks so as to close in the small rough granite plain north-east of
the latter mountain. Its highest peak, eight kilometres
north-north-west of Gebel Hamata, is 1,389 metres above sea-level.
It is drained on the south by the Wadi el Abiad, the same tributary
of Wadi Huluz which drains the north face of Hamata, and on the
north by the Wadi Abu Ghusun, which enters the sea separately.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Um Laham</span> is a mass of lower
hills a little west of Gebel Abu Ghusun, forming the side of Wadi
Huluz opposite to Gebel el Mahali.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Tarfawi</span> is a complex mountain
range fourteen kilometres north-west of Gebel Hamata. Its highest
point, at the north-west end of a ridge, is 1,363 metres above the
sea. It is probably drained to the south by the Wadi Tarfawi, a
tributary of Wadi Huluz, and to the north by feeders of Wadi
Romit.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Um Heshenib</span> is a great ridge
situated twenty-two kilometres north-west of Gebel Hamata. The
beacon on its highest point, in latitude 24° 20′ 49″, longitude 34°
50′ 53″, has an altitude of 1,135 metres above the sea. Its lower
parts are granite, but the upper third is of dark schists, while
the actual ridge on which the beacon stands is a grey porphyrite.
Gebel Um Heshenib is drained to the north by the Wadi el Abiad, a
tributary of Wadi Gemal, and<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_183">[183]</span> to the south by tributaries of Wadi Huluz.
I ascended it on two occasions from opposite sides. The north
approach is the easier road for camels, as they can pass easily up
the broad and sandy Wadi el Abiad, while to reach it from Wadi
Huluz one has to journey over a rather stony pass and along narrow
stony wadis. But the climb is longer from the north side, being one
of 635 metres against 380 metres from the south, and the southern
climb is easier as well as shorter. It is interesting to note that
as the ground south of the mountain lies at an average level of 250
metres higher than that to the north, the plumb-line ought from
theoretical considerations to be attracted to the south by several
seconds, and this was found to be the case when the mountain was
used as a latitude station (<em>see</em> <a href="#Page_47" class=
"pginternal">p. 47</a>) There is a very difficult pass east of the
mountain from the head of Wadi el Abiad into a tributary of Wadi
Huluz; I was told that loaded camels could not possibly get over
the pass, and have reason to believe the statement true, as
although I did not consent my men were desirous of going over it
and volunteered to carry the baggage over themselves to relieve the
camels.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel el Abiad</span> is the name given to
two distinct ranges of high granite hills on either side of the
Wadi el Abiad, north and east of Gebel Um Heshenib. The eastern of
these two ranges extends in a north-westerly direction for about
twelve kilometres from Gebel Tarfawi to near the place where Wadi
el Abiad turns to the north-east. It has numerous peaks, of which
the most conspicuous is at the south-east end of a high ridge six
and a half kilometres north-east of Gebel Um Heshenib, and rises to
957 metres above sea. This eastern range is drained from the west
by the Wadi el Abiad, and from the west by the Wadis Shoab and
Romit. The western range is slightly lower and less extensive; one
of its most conspicuous peaks, eleven kilometres north-north-east
of Um Heshenib, is 892 metres above the sea, and there are numerous
other peaks further south of almost equal altitude. This western
range is almost entirely drained by the Wadi el Abiad, a feeder of
which curves round the south end of the range, thus separating it
from Gebel Um Heshenib; the drainage from the north end probably
passes into the Wadi Mukhatatat, while a portion of the eastern
slopes may be drained by feeders of Wadi Durunkat. It is the coarse
white granitic sand resulting from the disintegration of the rocks
of these hills which gives its<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_184">[184]</span> name to the Wadi el Abiad, and the hills
take their name from the wadi. The heads of the wadi near Gebel Um
Heshenib are, however, blackened by hornblendic downwash from the
schists which overlie the granite of that mountain.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Shoab</span> is a very high white
granite hill close to the head of Wadi Shoab, on its north side. It
rises to 830 metres above the sea, or about 400 metres above the
wadi floor.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Hefeiri</span> is a very sharp granite
peak a little west of the Wadi Abu Ghusun, about fifteen kilometres
north of Hamata. Rising to 612 metres above the sea, or about 300
metres above the wadi near it, among lower granite hills, it is a
good landmark. There is a smaller very sharp peak two and a half
kilometres to the north-east, on the opposite side of the Wadi Abu
Ghusun, while to the west are sugar loaf shaped hills.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Um Sueh</span> is a conspicuous granite
hill six and a half kilometres east of the Wadi el Abiad and four
and a half kilometres north of the Wadi Shoab, rising to 781 metres
above sea. It is probably drained from the north-east by the heads
of Wadi Um el Abbas.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Um el Abbas</span> is a very remarkable
granite hill between Gebels Um Sueh and Abu Hegilig. From the
north, it looks like a square block with precipitous sides, having
a sheer drop of about 200 metres. Its summit is 697 metres above
sea. It is drained by the Wadi Um el Abbas, which goes
independently to the sea.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Abu Hegilig</span> is another high
granite hill, three and a half kilometres east of Gebel Um el Abbas
and twenty-six kilometres north of Gebel Hamata. Its summit, 607
metres above sea, is marked by a beacon, the position being
latitude 24° 26′ 16″, longitude 34° 58′ 32″. The hill is drained by
feeders of Wadi Um el Abbas. The camp from which I ascended the
hill was in one of these feeders 1,200 metres north-east of the
beacon and 267 metres above sea-level; the climb of 340 metres was
not difficult, and only occupied a little over an hour. The beacon
is on a block not large enough to take an instrument, so that
observations here were taken from an eccentric point a little way
along the ridge and afterwards reduced to centre.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Sarobi</span> is a small hill-range
twenty-two kilometres north-east of Gebel Hamata and some eleven
kilometres from the sea coast. The peak at its south end is 471
metres above sea-level. This range<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_185">[185]</span> has not been closely approached nor well
seen, but it must be very conspicuous to any one travelling in the
low hill country near the sea.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Ras el Kharit</span> is a mountain
range forming part of the main watershed, running in a nearly east
and west line a little south of Gebel Hamata. Its highest peak is
extremely sharp, and rises to 1,661 metres above sea-level six
kilometres south-south-east of Hamata. Of the many other peaks of
the range, the chief is one three kilometres west of the highest
point, and six kilometres due south of Hamata; this reaches an
altitude of 1,564 metres. The northern face of the range is drained
by the heads of the Wadi Huluz, while the southern is drained by
the heads of Wadi Kharit, whence the name of the mountain
range.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Khashir</span>, which forms an eastward
extension of Gebel Ras el Kharit, reaches an altitude of 1,565
metres above sea-level; its highest peak is nine and a half
kilometres south-east of Gebel Hamata. It is drained to the sea by
the Wadi Khashir, the heads of which end in the precipitous eastern
faces of the mountain.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Mikbi</span> is a long high ridge on
the main watershed, seven kilometres south of Gebel Khashir. Its
highest point, at the south end of the ridge, is 1,388 metres above
sea-level. Gebel Mikbi is connected with Gebel Ras el Kharit by a
lower ridge running north-west and forming the continuation of the
watershed across the head of Wadi el Kharit. There is a pass across
this ridge into the head of Wadi Mikbi, which drains Gebel Mikbi
seawards, but it is a very difficult one for loaded camels owing to
the great steepness of the eastern side.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Zatit</span> is another high ridge
about five kilometres east of Gebel Mikbi, on the south side of the
head of Wadi Mikbi.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Egat</span> is a high mountain close to
the south-west of Gebel Mikbi, forming the continuation of the
watershed. It has two principal peaks, two and a quarter kilometres
apart, of which the south-west one is the higher, being 1,422
metres, while the north-east one is 1,277 metres above the sea. The
western face of the mass is drained by the Wadi Egat, a tributary
of Kharit, while the eastern flanks are cut up by feeders of the
Wadi Sefent, a tributary of Wadi Lahami.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebels Um Sellim</span> and <span class=
"bold">Gumudlum</span> are high hill ranges forming an eastward
extension of the Egat and Mikbi mountains, on the north side of
Wadis Sefent and Lahami. The highest point of Gebel Um<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span> Sellim is 947 metres above
sea, or about 620 metres above the floor of Wadi Lahami. These
ranges are flanked by lower hills through which run various small
wadis such as Um Khuzuma, Um Ghobasha, and Gumudlum, all feeders of
Wadi Lahami. Some of these small wadis contain rock basins or galts
which retain large supplies of water for some time after rain has
fallen on the hills.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Abu Gurdi</span> is a great mountain in
latitude 24° 0′, forming the terminal peak to the south of the
Hamata group. The beacon on its summit, in latitude 24° 0′ 11″,
longitude 35° 5′ 17″, is 1,562 metres above sea-level. Though in
reality a ridge, Abu Gurdi from most points of view looks like a
rather flat cone, surrounded by lower hills. It is on the main
watershed, which crossing to the summit from Gebel Egat, continues
south-eastward along a narrow ridge descending to the pass at the
head of Wadi Lahami. The south-west parts of Abu Gurdi are drained
by the Wadis Abu Gurdi and Elemikan, both tributaries of Kharit,
while its southern and eastern parts drain into Wadi Lahami by
various feeders, of which the chief are the Wadis Um Karaba, Um
Rishan, Um Homar, and Sefent. Gebel Abu Gurdi could probably be
ascended from the west by following up the Wadi Abu Gurdi, but in
occupying the mountain as a triangulation station I descended the
Wadi Lahami as far as the point of influx of Wadi Um Karaba and
then ascended the latter wadi as far as the camels could get,
pitching my camp two kilometres south of the summit at 804 metres
above sea-level. The ascent of 758 metres to the beacon on foot
from the camp occupied two and a quarter hours of fairly stiff
climbing; it presented no serious difficulties, but the rock near
the top is much broken up and one has to be careful lest blocks are
dislodged under one’s foot. The view from the top of Abu Gurdi on a
clear day must be extremely fine, but during the three days I
remained there a thin haze spoiled the distant prospect, especially
towards the coast; the remarkable shapes of the granite peaks of
Gebel Faraid, sixty kilometres to the south-south-east, formed the
most striking feature in the scene.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Derhib</span>, 1,160 metres above the
sea, is a mountain separating Wadi Abu Gurdi from Wadi Egat; it is
really an extension of Gebel Abu Gurdi, from the beacon on which
its summit is six and a half kilometres west.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span><span class=
"bold">Gebel Um Goradi</span> is likewise in reality part of the
Abu Gurdi mass, forming the end of a spur extending south-eastward
for ten kilometres from the main peak. The Wadi Lahami curves round
its foot northward, passing between it and Gebel Um Gunud.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Selaia</span><a id=
"FNanchor_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107" class=
"fnanchor">[107]</a> (the bald head) is a very remarkable rounded
granite boss rising from the plain thirty-one kilometres
south-south-west of Gebel Hamata. Owing to its peculiar shape,
isolated position, and considerable height (its top is 787 metres
above sea-level and about 260 metres above the plain), Selaia is a
conspicuous landmark for great distances round it. The lower
illustration on <a href="#pl11b">Plate XI</a> (p. 172) gives an
idea of its appearance as seen from the east; from the north or
south it appears much steeper.</p>

<p>South-east of Gebel Selaia stretches a line of four smaller
granite hills. The first of these, about a kilometre from the great
boss, is interesting as having a small spring, called Megal el
Selaia, at its foot. The next, one and a half kilometres further
on, is larger, while the third is larger still, rising to 623
metres above sea-level. The fourth, five kilometres from Gebel
Selaia, is marked by a triangulation beacon, 563 metres above
sea-level and about fifty metres above the plain, in latitude 23°
55′ 30″, longitude 34° 54′ 37″.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel el Homur</span> is an isolated mass of
granite hills on the plain six kilometres north-east of Selaia. Its
highest point is 731 metres above sea and 230 metres above the
plain at its foot. It is drained by small feeders of the Wadi Abu
Gurdi, which passes north of the mass on its way across the plain
to join Wadi Kharit.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Abu Derega</span> is an isolated mass
of higher granite hills thirteen kilometres south-east of Gebel
Selaia. Its highest point is 831 metres above sea-level, and about
300 metres above the plain. Gebel Abu Derega is on the Nile — Red
Sea watershed, which crosses the plain from east to west in this
locality. The northern drainage is to the Wadi Elemikan, which runs
between Gebels Abu Derega and Selaia to join Wadi Kharit, while the
southern faces of the hills are drained by feeders of the Wadi el
Khiua, a tributary of Wadi Um Bisilla, in the basin of Wadi
Hodein.</p>

<p>Besides the hills above described, there are many smaller
ones<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span> scattered at
intervals over the great sandy plain of Selaia, but the only others
calling for special notice are the three very remarkable white
conical hills called <span class="bold">Marwot Elemikan</span>,
situated twelve kilometres east of Abu Derega. These hills, though
small, are conspicuous from considerable distances, owing to the
dazzling appearance of the pure milk-white quartz of which they are
composed. The highest and most northerly one, with a triangulation
beacon on its summit, rises to 648 metres above sea, or 68 metres
above the plain, in latitude 23° 54′ 14″, longitude 35° 6′ 8″. The
other two lie about two kilometres south-east and south
respectively, with a black hill mid-way between them.</p>

<h3><a id="c06s03"></a>The Um Gunud — Dahanib — Batoga Group.</h3>

<p>The mountains of this group, occupying the country east of the
watershed between Wadi Lahami and Wadi Khoda, are considerably
lower than those of the preceding two groups, only a few peaks
rising more than 1,000 metres above sea. The north portion of the
group is formed by the line of mountain ridges which as seen from
the sea near Berenice appears to connect Gebel Kalalat with Abu
Gurdi, while the south part spreads further east and west and
contains the highest peaks.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Um Gunud</span> is the northernmost
mountain of the range west of Berenice. It is a dark rugged ridge,
surmounted by a cairn<a id="FNanchor_108"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> 989 metres above
sea-level, forming the east side of the Wadi Lahami opposite Gebel
Abu Gurdi. It is drained from the west by the Wadi Um Gunud, a
feeder of Wadi Lahami, and on the east by feeders of Wadi Naait.
Gullies in the west flanks of the mountain contain rock basins,
called Galt Um Gunud, which hold water supplies for a long time
after rain has fallen, and which are fairly easy of access from
Wadi Lahami.</p>

<p>Gebel Eidab, the next member of the range to the south, rises to
848 metres above sea. It is drained on the west by the Wadi Eidab,
a tributary of Wadi Lahami, and on the east by the Wadi Abu Daba, a
tributary of Wadi Mukhit; a rough and steep pass is said to exist
from east to west between the heads of these two wadis near the
mountain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span><span class=
"bold">Gebel Um Maiat</span>, a long high ridge stretching
south-east from Gebel Eidab, has three marked summits near its ends
and centre; that at the north end, which is the highest, is 928
metres, while the other two are 870 and 842 metres above sea
respectively. Another broken ridge, of similar height, for which I
could get no name from my guides, forms a south-eastern
prolongation of Um Maiat, and extends to the Wadi Kalalat; this
likewise has three well defined summits, rising in order from north
to south, to 875, 821, and 627 metres respectively. These ridges
are drained to the east by the Wadis Murra (tributary of Abu Daba)
and Mindeit. Their western drainage has not been studied in detail,
but it all reaches the sea, none of it going Nilewards; part of the
drainage is probably taken by each of the Wadis Kalalat, Shut, and
El Khiua.</p>

<p>To the east and north-east of the Um Gunud — Eidab — Um Maiat
range is a great expanse of lower hill country through which the
wadis cut their way eastwards for about fifteen kilometres to the
coast plain. The most conspicuous peaks in this lower hill country
are Gebels Um Huk, Abu Ghalqa, and Um Hegilig, all situated in its
north portion round about Wadis Lahami and Naait. Other low rugged
hills fill a triangular tract south-west of the main range.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Um Huk</span> is a sharp granite peak,
surmounted by a cairn,<a id="FNanchor_109"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> rising to 517 metres
above sea-level near the south side of Wadi Lahami, fourteen
kilometres north-north-east of Gebel Um Gunud.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Abu Ghalqa</span> is another high
granite hill, also marked by a cairn on its summit, seven
kilometres south-south-east of Um Huk. The cairn is 561 metres
above sea-level, and is in latitude 24° 1′ 7″, longitude 35° 16′
47″.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Um Hegilig</span> in a small rather
spiky range of red granite hills situated a little to the
north-east of Gebel Um Gunud, near the heads of Wadi Naait.</p>

<p>To the north-west of Berenice are several low hills on the coast
plain, which serve as landmarks and bear special names.
<span class="bold">Grain el Rih</span> is a conspicuous isolated
low hill nearly opposite the place where Wadi Naait emerges from
the hills on to the plain, thirteen and a half kilometres
north-west of Berenice. <span class="bold">Khasheib Abu Daba</span>
is the name of some low bouldery granite hills at the place where
Wadi Abu Daba<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
enters the plain. <span class="bold">Sikeit</span>, a landmark for
Berenice, from which it lies five kilometres north-west, is a low
granite hill, isolated on the plain and very conspicuous; its
summit is seventy metres above sea-level, or thirty-eight metres
above the plain at its foot.</p>

<p>The <span class="bold">Hills on the Peninsula of Ras
Benas</span> are sharply marked off into two portions by
differences of colour. The most striking are the dazzling white
hills of gypseous limestone which form a narrow sinuous broken
plateau nearly along the long axis of the peninsula. The highest
points of these white hills are 188 metres above the sea. Deep
ravines cut up the plateau and separate it into more or less
detached hills. The surface of the gypseous rock is very rough, and
frequently weathered into knife-like projections which cut one’s
hands and boots badly in climbing. Near the tip of the peninsula
the gypseous beds contain a little sulphur in places, and there are
some shallow pits which seem to have been dug for exploiting that
mineral. But the quantity appears far too small to be of any
commercial value, and the pits were probably only exploratory trial
holes.</p>

<p>The other hills on the peninsula are darker in colour, being
chiefly diorite. They form two masses, one near to where the
peninsula joins the main land, and the other on the south side of
the peninsula twenty kilometres east of Berenice. The highest point
of the first-named group is 276 metres, while that of the second is
197 metres, above sea-level. All the hills on the peninsula are
quite separated from those of the main land by the broad sandy
plain through which Wadi Mukhit courses south-eastwards to the
sea.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Batoga</span>, a granite mountain
fifteen kilometres south-east of Berenice, is sharply marked off
from the other mountains near it by its light colour. It is a great
boss of acid granite seamed with dykes, having two main peaks. The
highest (central) peak rises to 802 metres above sea-level; the
southern peak, surmounted by a triangulation beacon in latitude 23°
49′ 37″, longitude 35° 21′ 9″, is seventeen metres lower. Gebel
Batoga is drained from the north by feeders of the Wadi Kalalat,
and from the south by the Wadi Kunserob. There is a good water
source, Galt Batoga, at its north-east foot, consisting of a rock
basin which holds a good supply of water for a long time after
rain, situated in a small gully close to the Wadi Kalalat, the
floor of which is here about 160 metres above sea-level.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span><span class=
"bold">Gebel Kalalat</span>, situated about six kilometres west of
Gebel Batoga, is a mass of ridges, higher and darker in colour than
Batoga. Its highest point, marked by a beacon in latitude 23° 49′
9″, longitude 35° 17′ 36″, is 1,125 metres above the sea, while
another conspicuous peak one and a half kilometres north-east of
the beacon, rises to 1,080 metres, and there is a third peak three
and a half kilometres south-east of the beacon which attains 894
metres. In ascending Gebel Kalalat to occupy the triangulation
station, I followed up the Wadi Kalalat to where the little winding
Wadi Um Maiat enters it from the south, then turned up the latter
wadi and pitched my camp as far up as the camels could go. The camp
was three kilometres north-east of the beacon and 300 metres above
sea, so that the climb to be made on foot was 825 metres. Though
long and tiring, the ascent to the beacon was not dangerous.
Further up the head of the wadi than my camp, I came on a line of
galts (rock basins) containing rain water, but they were not easy
of access to camels, being in a steep and stony gorge. Perched on
the east flank of Kalalat is a very remarkable pinnacle rock, well
seen in the illustration on <a href="#pl14">Plate XIV.</a> A very
good view of the surrounding mountains is obtained from the summit
in clear weather, but the top was wrapped in clouds for a great
part of two out of the four days I remained on it. Gebel Kalalat is
drained from the north by feeders of the Wadi Kalalat, and from the
south by the Wadis Gumudlum and Kunserob. Wadi Kalalat curves round
the north-west side of the mass, and it is possible that the ascent
might be easier by following that wadi as far as possible and
climbing up the north-west face of the mountain. A rough steep
pass, impracticable for loaded camels, is said to lead from the
head of Wadi Kalalat into Wadi Shut.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Dibag</span> is a high dark ridge five
kilometres south of Gebel Batoga, with a peak at each end. The
north-west peak is 517 metres, and the south-east one 544 metres
above sea-level. The Wadi Kunserob curves round its east and south
flanks, while the Wadi Dibag lil Kunserob drains its eastern face
into the same channel.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Shenshef</span> is a mass of high dark
hills between the Wadis Shenshef and Gumudlum, close to the Wadi
Khoda. On one of its eastern peaks, situated in latitude 23° 44′
5″, longitude 35° 22′ 40″, on the west side of Wadi Shenshef, and
not so high as others further west, a beacon has been erected
overlooking the ruins called Hitan Shenshef. There are wells in the
wadi a short distance below this<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_192">[192]</span> hill. The beacon is 290 metres above the
sea and 115 metres above the wadi floor at its foot.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Dahanib</span> is a mountain of dark
coloured rocks (diorite and gabbro), situated twelve and half
kilometres south-east of Gebel Kalalat and eleven kilometres north
of the Wadi Khoda. Its summit, on which is a triangulation beacon,
is in latitude 23° 45′ 44″, longitude 35″ 11′ 10″, and 1,270 metres
above sea-level. Gebel Dahanib is surrounded by other mountains and
hills, and access to it is not very easy. In order to reach it from
Gebel Kalalat I had to make a journey down the Wadi Kalalat, along
the coast-plain and up the Wadis Khoda and Allawi, a total distance
of over eighty kilometres, although the direct distance between the
two peaks is only twelve and a half kilometres. By ascending one of
the heads of the Wadi Allawi until camels could get no further, I
was able to pitch a camp 540 metres above sea-level and three
kilometres south-west of the beacon, leaving 730 metres to be
climbed on foot. The ascent, though tiring, was free from
difficulties or dangers, and occupied two and a half hours. A galt,
containing only a small supply of water at the time of my visit,
exists a little further up the head of the wadi than where I fixed
my camp. There is a good view from the summit, but in the winter
months Dahanib, like all the mountains near the coast, is
frequently wrapped in clouds for days together. Of seven days spent
on the summit in February 1907, three were passed entirely in
clouds, while only portions of the other four were free from fog or
haze. It was on Gebel Dahanib that I first noticed the curious
electric phenomena which may be observed at high stations when
electrified clouds are passing close overhead, my attention being
first drawn to them by a spark from the eye-piece of my theodolite
striking me over the eye. At the same moment a rapid succession of
sparks a centimetre or so long passed between my hand and the
adjusting screws of the instrument, while both the theodolite and
my hair hissed loudly. In this and all other cases of a like kind,
I judged it best to suspend operations for a time and descend a
little below the summit till the cloud had passed over.</p>

<p>Gebel Dahanib is drained by the Wadis Allawi, Um Tawil, and
Shut, all tributaries of Wadi Khoda, which course for a
considerable distance through the surrounding hills before reaching
the main trunk wadi.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>Gebels Um
Hegilig, Reyan, and Shut, are high hills situated between the Wadis
Shut and Gumudlum, both tributaries of Khoda. <span class=
"bold">Gebel Um Hegilig</span>, a dark peak rising to 966 metres
above sea-level, is almost exactly midway between Gebels Dahanib
and Kalalat. <span class="bold">Gebel Reyan</span>, a little
further south-east, is a group of peaks and ridges of which the
highest point is 863 metres above sea. <span class="bold">Gebel
Shut</span>, the most remarkable of the three, is a great cone
rising to 930 metres above sea, about five kilometres north of the
Wadi Khoda. A very large galt is said to exist among these hills,
approachable from Wadi Shut; it is probably in one of the feeders
draining westward from Gebel Reyan, which name signifies “the wet
mountain.”</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Um Bisilla</span> is a dark mountain of
gabbro rising conspicuously among lower hills twenty-two kilometres
west of Gebel Dahanib. The triangulation beacon on its summit is in
latitude 23° 45′ 34″, longitude 34° 57′ 39″, and 824 metres above
sea-level. Gebel Um Bisilla is drained by Wadi Um Bisilla, the head
of which encircles its southern half, while the northern flanks are
drained by feeders of the Wadi el Khiua, which courses south-west
to join Wadi Um Bisilla about ten kilometres west of the mountain.
There is an easy passage for camels round the east side of the
mountain from the head of Wadi Um Bisilla into a feeder of Wadi Abu
Nilih, a tributary of Wadi El Khiua. In ascending the mountain I
pitched my camp in one of the gullies draining from it to Wadi Um
Bisilla, at an altitude of 513 metres above sea and 1,300 metres
south-east of the beacon. The climb of 311 metres from this camp to
the summit presented no difficulties, and occupied only an hour and
a half.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Erf el Gimal</span> is a high dark ridge
surrounded by lower hills ten kilometres west-south-west of Gebel
Um Bisilla. Its highest point, the west end of the ridge, is 673
metres above sea. About seven kilometres further west is a
conspicuous conical hill called <span class="bold">Gebel Abu
Shigelat</span>.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Zergat Naam</span>, sometimes called
<span class="bold">Hagar el Fil</span>, is a mountain mass on the
main watershed thirty kilometres west of Gebel Um Bisilla. It forms
a curved range round the head of the Wadi el Kreim, a tributary of
Garara. Its northern part is drained partly by the Wadi Abu Had, a
feeder of the Rod el Kharuf, and partly by the heads of the Wadi el
Fil, which is itself the head of Wadi Naam. The highest peak of the
range is a conical one near its south end, 845 metres<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span> above sea-level, but the
northern peaks are more conspicuous from some points of view, and
it is on the highest of these, 823 metres above sea, in latitude
23° 45′ 28″, longitude 34° 40′ 34″, that the triangulation beacon
has been erected. My camp at the base was in one of the heads of
Wadi el Fil, 527 metres above the sea, and about 700 metres
north-east of the beacon. The ascent from here on foot to the
beacon was fairly easy. Zergat Naam is a mass of syenite rising
through schists, but the northern summits are formed by east and
west bands of a very hard quartz felsite. From the summit, looking
northwards one sees long lines of north-and-south felsite dykes
forming ridges on either side of the head of Rod el Kharuf, while
close south of one is the enclosed sloping plain across which run
the feeders of Wadi el Kreim. To the south-south-east, a range of
lower hills runs north-westward from the end of the main range, and
between the two there appears to be a remarkably sudden drop into
the head of Wadi Abu Seyal. The Arabs state that there is a very
large galt at this point, reached by ascending the Wadi Abu Seyal;
the galt is said to hold water for five months after rain. But
during my occupation of the station recent rains had filled other
smaller rock basins in the gullies to the north, and it was
unnecessary to send far from the camp to get supplies. It is
interesting to observe from the summit of Zergat Naam the
disposition of the rocks forming the lower hills to the south and
west; these are of sandstones with marked dips, the area being one
of much disturbance by faulting along the Wadi el Kreim.</p>

<p>On the great sandy plain to the north and north-east of Zergat
Naam are two extensive groups of low hills, which stand out
remarkably owing to their dark colour. One of these groups, twenty
kilometres north of Zergat Naam, is called <span class="bold">Gebel
Geneina Gharbi</span>; it is a mass of hills composed chiefly of
dioritic and gabbroid rocks (through there are some schists and
granites intermingled) and is drained northward by the Rod el
Geneina, a feeder of Wadi Kharit. The other group, called
<span class="bold">Gebel Geneina Sharqi</span>, is smaller and
situated fifteen kilometres further east; I did not visit it, but
from its dark colour it is probable that it consists of similar
rocks to those above-mentioned. The hills of both groups rise to
about 550 metres above the sea, or about eighty to one hundred
metres above the plain.</p>

<p>In the low country to the west of Zergat Naam, between the Wadi
Garara and the Rod el Kharuf, the most conspicuous hills
are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span> <span class=
"bold">Erf el Dubeis</span>, a ridge twenty-six kilometres due west
of the beacon, <span class="bold">Gebel el Nikeiba</span>, a
granite hill marked by a triangulation cairn, 570 metres above
sea-level and thirty-four kilometres west-north-west of Zergat
Naam; <span class="bold">Gebel Felieiti</span>, a sandstone hill,
also marked by a triangulation cairn, 500 metres above sea and
sixteen kilometres south-west of Gebel Nikeiba; <span class=
"bold">Erf Abu Homur</span>, a ridge at the head of Wadi Abu Homur
(a tributary of Garara), about seven kilometres north of Gebel
Felieiti; <span class="bold">Erf el Mohaib</span>, marked by a
triangulation cairn 465 metres above sea-level, about nine
kilometres north-west of the last-named hill; and <span class=
"bold">Gebel el Ghar</span>, a hill on the south side of Wadi el
Kharit, close to the point where the Rod el Kharuf enters it.</p>

<h3><a id="c06s04"></a>The Abu Dahr — Orga — Um Tenedba Group.</h3>

<p>The mountains of this group occupy the tract between the Wadi
Naam and Gebel Faraid, and are limited on the south by the Wadi
Hodein.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Abu Dahr</span>, the highest mountain
of the group, is a great mass of serpentine, situated in latitude
23° 35′ and about forty kilometres from the coast. Its summit,
marked by a triangulation beacon in latitude 23° 36′ 8″, longitude
35° 5′ 46″, is 1,131 metres above sea-level. Its western face is
drained by the heads of Wadi Betan, its north-east flanks by those
of Wadi Khoda, and its south-east parts by feeders of Wadi Rahaba.
Abu Dahr is surrounded by high hills except on the west, where
there is low hilly country containing the wells of Betan and the
old mining ruins of Um Eleiga (<em>see</em> <a href="#pl04">Plate
IV,</a> p. 30). The mountain can be most easily reached either by
following up the Wadi Betan to its head, or by ascending the Wadi
Salib el Azrak (a tributary of Wadi Khoda) and its feeder the Wadi
Um Karaba. There is an easy pass 1,800 metres north of the beacon,
between the central mass of Abu Dahr and the high hills north of
it, connecting the heads of Wadi Betan and Wadi Um Karaba. A short
distance to the south-west of this pass there is a galt in a spur
of the mountain which holds water for some time after rain, and
which furnished supplies during my stay at the place in 1907. In
occupying the triangulation station, I fixed my camp in a small
stony wadi draining from the north of the mountain, on the east
side of the pass just referred to; the camp was 600
metres<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span> above
sea-level and 1,200 metres north-north-east of the beacon. The
ascent, which occupied three hours, was rather difficult and
dangerous, the mountain being not only steep<a id=
"FNanchor_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110" class=
"fnanchor">[110]</a> but composed of rotten highly crushed rock
which came away in tons at a mere touch. There is a very extensive
view from the summit, the striking peaks of Faraid being a marked
feature to the east and south-east, while to the south are the
great masses of Mishbih, Niqrub and Gerf, with the sandstone
plateaux of Dif, Hodein and Abraq limiting the view to the
south-west. The rock of Gebel Abu Dahr is highly magnetic, and
several pieces which I examined showed strong polarity. The compass
needle points in all sorts of directions as one moves about the
mountain.</p>

<p>Gebel Abu Dahr and the high hills round it, especially to the
south, form an important rain-collecting area, the drainage from
which feeds, wholly or in part, the wells of Betan, Rahaba, Abu
Reye, Abu Beid, and Gahlia, all of which are within a radius of
about fifteen kilometres of the summit of the mountain. The
relative abundance of water in this area is caused by two main
factors. In the first place, the situation of the mountain on the
eastward side of the watershed, only about forty kilometres from
the coast, and its considerable height, condition the frequent
accumulation of clouds about its summit, with relatively high
rainfall as a consequence. And in the second place, the steepness
of the slopes, and the fact that the serpentine rocks are not only
of an impermeable nature, but are so crushed that the downwash into
the gullies around is chiefly composed of smooth faced blocks
rather than of absorbent sand, condition a higher ratio of run off
to rainfall than exists in the case of most other localities in the
Eastern Desert. A similar state of things is found in the case of
Gebel Gerf, which, as will be mentioned further on, likewise
consists of serpentine and is the centre of a district relatively
rich in good wells; while in the case of the mountains of Faraid,
which are much higher and closer to the sea, but consist of granite
weathering into sand, though the rainfall is probably greater, the
absorption by the sand is so rapid that there are no wells known to
exist in their neighbourhood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>Between Gebel
Abu Dahr and Gebel Um Bisilla there are three remarkable little
groups of granite hills. <span class="bold">Gebel Abu Arta</span>
is a small range of red peaks six kilometres south of Um Bisilla;
<span class="bold">Gebel Hendusi</span>, five kilometres further
south, is a very conspicuous sharp granite peak rising to 678
metres above the sea and forming a good landmark; while
<span class="bold">Gebel Abu Husenat</span>, four kilometres east
of Hendusi, has another well-marked peak rising to 725 metres above
sea-level.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Abu Sieiyil</span> is a many-peaked
hill range running north and south for about four kilometres,
situated eight kilometres west of the beacon on Gebel Abu Dahr. It
has the appearance of being composed of a pink gneiss, but has not
been visited. Its central peak, fixed by triangulation, is 833
metres above sea. The Wadi Abu Beid el Azrak runs south-westward
past the south end of the range, through a gap between it and a
smaller hill range to the east.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Arais</span> is a considerable range of
gneiss peaks situated on the east side of Wadi Naam in latitude 23°
34′. One of the most conspicuous of its many summits is a pair of
twin peaks near the south end of the range, rising to 613 metres
above the sea. The range is cut through from east to west by the
narrow and winding Wadi Arais, a tributary of Wadi Naam. The
drainage from the western faces of the range passes by many feeders
over a sandy plain to join the Wadi Naam directly.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Belamhandeit</span> or <span class=
"bold">Erf Um Araka</span> is a long range of granite or gneiss
hills north of Gebel Arais. It extends for a length of nine
kilometres in a north-and-south direction on the meridian of 34°
50′. It is drained on the north and west by the Wadi Erf Um Araka,
a tributary of Wadi Naam, and on the east by the Wadi Belamhandeit,
a tributary of Wadi Arais.</p>

<p>To the east of Gebel Belamhandeit are several granite bosses, of
which the most conspicuous is called <span class="bold">Gebel Um
Guruf</span>; it is drained by the Wadi Um Guruf, a tributary of
Wadi Arais.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Orga</span>, eighteen kilometres south
by east from Gebel Abu Dahr, is a high dark-looking range which has
not been closely approached. Its highest peak, surmounted by a
beacon, the position of which has been fixed by triangulation, as
latitude 23° 26′ 21″, longitude 35° 8′ 17″, is 682 metres above
sea-level. It is drained by the Wadi Orga (a tributary of Wadi
Hodein), which contains the well called Bir Orga.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span><span class=
"bold">Gebel Um Tenedba</span> is a mass of dark hills of crushed
basic rocks situated thirty kilometres south by east from Gebel Abu
Dahr and twelve kilometres north of the Wadi Hodein. Its highest
point, marked by a triangulation beacon, is in latitude 23° 19′
48″, longitude 35° 10′ 40″, and 654 metres above sea-level. It is
drained by the Wadi Um Tenedba, a tributary of Wadi Hodein. The
ascent of the hill is conveniently made in about an hour from a
camp in one of the heads of Wadi Um Tenedba, about 1,200 metres
south-east of the beacon and 320 metres above sea-level.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Harhagit</span> is an isolated granite
boss rising among schists ten kilometres south-south-east from
Gebel Um Tenedba and five kilometres north of the Wadi Hodein. The
beacon on its summit is in latitude 23° 14′ 35″, longitude 35° 12′
52″, at an altitude of 542 metres above sea-level, or 326 metres
above the wadi encircling its base. From its isolated character
Gebel Harhagit is a conspicuous landmark for considerable distances
round the Wadi Hodein.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel el Anbat</span> is conveniently
considered here, though it lies on the south side of the Wadi
Hodein. It presents a somewhat similar appearance to Gebel
Harhagit, from which it lies nineteen kilometres south-east, and
like it bears a beacon on its summit. The position of the beacon is
latitude 23° 6′ 5″, longitude 35° 19′ 27″. El Anbat is lower than
Harhagit, being only 390 metres above sea-level; it consists also
of a different rock, being chiefly composed of curious brown and
reddish calcareous schists. Gebel el Anbat is practically in the
Wadi Hodein, the main channel of which is deviated by its
foot-hills so as to pass round the east side of the hill. It is
best ascended from the south, where a camp can be fixed about 600
metres south of the beacon and about 255 metres below it; the
ascent is easy and occupies less than an hour.</p>

<p>Eastward of Gebel Abu Dahr there extends for some thirty
kilometres along the south side of Wadi Khoda a mountainous tract
of dark rocks, the principal masses of which, from west to east,
bear the names of Gebel Hindia, Gebel Um Akra, and Gebel Um Etli.
These mountains have only been seen from a distance, and little is
known about them beyond the positions and altitudes of their
principal peaks, which have been fixed by triangulation.
<span class="bold">Gebel Hindia</span>, thirteen kilometres east of
Abu Dahr, rises to 873 metres above sea-level, and is drained
partly by the Wadi Hindia to the north, and<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_199">[199]</span> partly by the Wadi Salib el Azrak.
<span class="bold">Gebel Um Akra</span>, six kilometres further
east, is higher, its highest peak, marked by a beacon, being 1,050
metres above the sea, while a ridge a little further south reaches
970 metres; it is drained to Wadi Khoda by the Wadi Um Akra.
<span class="bold">Gebel Um Etli</span>, which forms the south side
of the Wadi Khoda just before that wadi emerges on to the
coast-plain, has three main summits, reaching respectively to 844,
795, and 764 metres above the sea. It is a rather extensive mass,
drained on the north by the Wadis Buluk and Um Lassaf, tributaries
of Wadi Khoda, and on the south by the Wadi Um Etli, which reaches
the sea independently.</p>

<h3><a id="c06s05"></a>The Faraid Group.</h3>

<p>The mountains of this group cover a tract about forty kilometres
in length from north to south, between the Wadis Um Etli and Rahaba
and lie closer to the sea than any other mountains in the area
described, their peaks being only ten to twelve kilometres from the
coast. They consist entirely of granite, weathered into a forest of
peaks the forms of which render them in respect of shape the most
remarkable mountains in Egypt. There are four main masses in the
group, of which the three northern ones are called collectively
Faraid, while the southern one, which is smaller than, and
separated from, the rest, is called by the diminutive name
Fereyid.</p>

<p>The most northern mass of <span class="bold">Gebel Faraid</span>
is the highest, its principal peak, situated in latitude 23° 33′
7″, longitude 35° 22′ 10″, being 1,366 metres above sea-level. As
seen from the north, this mass appears somewhat like an outspread
hand, its western peak seeming to overhang slightly like a thumb,
while the higher eastern peaks resemble fingers. The name <em>Mons
Pentadactylus</em> given to the mountain in antiquity, and quoted
by Ptolemy, would appear to have referred only to this northern
mass, and not to the Faraid group as a whole.</p>

<p>The second mass presents from most aspects the form of a nearly
flat-topped mountain with a little peak on it and very steep sides.
Its highest point, situated in latitude 23° 30′ 53″, longitude 35°
20′ 25″, is 1,259 metres above sea, and forms a main triangulation
point; it is too sharp to support an instrument or even a beacon,
and observations had to be taken from an auxiliary station a little
distance away<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span> from
the summit and reduced to centre. In ascending this peak as a
survey station I approached it from the west by the Wadi el Abiad
and Wadi Abu Ribian, placing my camp close under the mountain, on a
sandy plain 450 metres above sea-level and one and a half
kilometres north-west of the summit. The climb of 800 metres was
steep, but not dangerous, and occupied about three hours. The lower
illustration on <a href="#pl14b">Plate XIV</a> (p. 192) shows the
top of the mountain; the lower of the two peaks is the one occupied
for triangulation.</p>

<p>The third mass of Faraid is a great expanse of peaks extending
over eighteen kilometres north and south and some twelve kilometres
east and west. Its highest peak, called “The Bodkin” by the
Admiralty surveyors, has the position latitude 23° 28′ 58″,
longitude 35° 20′ 35″, and rises to 1,232 metres above sea-level,
dominating the rest of the mass both by its height and its singular
form; it is a great sharp pinnacle, apparently unclimbable, visible
from distances of over 100 kilometres in nearly all directions, and
a very conspicuous landmark. South and west of “The Bodkin” are
numerous other peaks, some of which have been fixed by
triangulation; several of them rise to over 900 metres above the
sea, and the whole forms a compact mass across which there appears
to be no passage for camels.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Fereyid</span>, the fourth and most
southerly of the masses constituting the Faraid group, is a small
spiky range quite detached from the rest, about seven kilometres
north of the Wadi Rahaba. It has two main peaks, close together, of
which the north-western one is slightly the higher and is
surmounted by a beacon, 612 metres above sea-level, in latitude 23°
17′ 29″, longitude 35° 22′ 48″. In occupying this peak as a
triangulation station, the camp was fixed in one of the heads of a
nameless wadi draining past the north face of the mountain to the
sea, at an altitude of 200 metres above sea-level and 850 metres
north-north-east of the beacon. The ascent was easy till within
about fifty metres of the summit, when it became difficult and
rather dangerous, and there is very little room on the top. I had
to remain six days on this mountain owing to almost continuous haze
and clouds blocking the view.</p>

<p>The drainage from the western faces of the entire Faraid group
is taken by the Wadi Rahaba. That from the peaks north of “The
Bodkin” is collected by the Wadi el Abiad and its feeders the Rod
Elbel and Wadi Abu Ribian, while the more southern<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span> parts are drained by various
other tributaries of Wadi Rahaba, of which the principal are the
Wadis Dagalai lil Rahaba, Abu Had, and el Marafai. The heads of
Wadi el Abiad and its feeders cross a sloping sandy plain which
flanks the main peaks on the west. Of the eastern drainage, less
has been seen; the two principal drainers of the eastern face
appear to be the Wadis el Sorubiab and Bint el Kurdum, which unite
together in a small lagoon close to the coast in latitude 23° 30′.
The head of the Wadi Bint el Kurdum is between “The Bodkin” and the
flat-topped mountain to the north of it, and from the summit of the
latter it appeared as though there might be a possible pass by it
across the range into the heads of Wadi Abu Ribian; but I did not
have an opportunity of testing this. The foot-hills are only some
five or six kilometres from the coast near the north parts of the
range, but as one goes south the width of the coast-plain increases
somewhat, and is about twelve kilometres near Gebel Fereyid.
Notwithstanding the height of the Faraid mountains, their proximity
to the coast, and the clouds they frequently attract, there appear
to be no wells in the wadis draining from them; the explanation is
probably to be sought in the fact that the weathering of the
granite of which they are composed produces large expanses of
coarse sand round their feet, in which the rainfall is rapidly
absorbed.</p>

<h3><a id="c06s06"></a>The Awamtib — Abraq — Dif — Aqab el Negum —
Mishbih Group.</h3>

<p>The mountains of this large and irregular group occupy the
western parts of the great drainage basin of Wadi Hodein, some of
the chief of them forming the main watershed separating that basin
from those of the Wadis Kharit and Alaqi. The northern mountains of
the group are high broken sandstone plateaux, while the southern
ones consist largely of granite. The sandstone ranges of Abraq,
Hodein, and Dif are remarkable for the numerous springs at their
bases, which render this district (<em>see</em> the large scale map
on <a href="#pl15">Plate XV</a>) one of great importance to
travellers.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Awamtib</span> is the highest peak of a
great mass of high sandstone hills forming the main watershed
between latitudes 23° 20′ and 23° 30′ and extending for some eight
or ten kilometres on either side of the meridian of 34° 30′. The
highest peaks of the mass are mostly well<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_202">[202]</span> to the west of the actual watershed, and
the principal drainage channels run westward, those to the east,
the feeders of Wadi Muegil, being shorter. Gebel Awamtib is near to
the south-east corner of this mass, and is itself situated about
six kilometres west of the watershed. It is nearly separated from
the surrounding hills by wadis, and forms a conspicuous peak from
the west; but the neighbouring hills approach it so nearly in
height that it is not so easily distinguished from the east. It
may, however, be picked out by the triangulation beacon which marks
its summit, 793 metres above sea-level, in latitude 23° 20′ 59″,
longitude 34° 26′ 39″. Gebel Awamtib is drained westward by the
Wadi Awamtib (a tributary of Wadi Timsah), the heads of which
nearly surround it. In occupying the station I pitched my camp in a
small feeder of the Wadi Awamtib, two and a quarter kilometres
south-west of the summit and 456 metres above sea-level. The climb
from this place was easy enough, but rather long, and on reaching
the top I found it would have been better to have approached the
mountain by another feeder almost due west of the beacon, as by
this means a camp could have been placed much closer and the ascent
would not have been more difficult. It is inadvisable to ascend
from the east face of the mountain, for although one of the wadi
heads passes close east of the beacon, the slope on that side is
extremely steep and probably unscalable. The top of the mountain is
formed of large sandstone blocks under which one can get good
shelter from dews, though with little head-room. The view from it
is shut in to the east by the peaks of Gebel Shebakhit, only two
kilometres distant; but the peaks of Gebels Um Harba and Zergat
Naam can be seen to the north, while to the south and south-east
one looks out over high sandstone hills in the foreground to the
granite peaks of Gebels Shigigat, Aqab el Negum, Etresia, Um Reit
and Saalek. The most striking thing round Awamtib itself is the
strong westward dip of the sandstone beds of which it is composed,
which has conditioned the drainage and the steep eastern face.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Shebakhit</span> is a group of high
sandstone hills a few kilometres north of Awamtib. It is drained
north-westward by the broad Wadi Shebakhit, a tributary of Wadi
Timsah.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Dagalai</span>, the next member of the
sandstone hill-mass to the north, has numerous peaks ranging from
670 to 712 metres above sea. It is drained north-westward by the
Wadi Dagalai, in which it is said that water can sometimes be
obtained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span><span class=
"bold">Gebel Um Khafur</span> is a group of high sandstone ridges
overlooking the sandy plain of Um Harba to the north. One of its
higher ridges, 560 metres above sea-level, bears a triangulation
station, marked by a beacon, in latitude 23° 29′ 54″, longitude 34°
29′ 19″. A remarkable feature of Gebel Um Khafur is the
north-north-easterly dip of its sandstone beds at an angle of about
13°, almost constant over a large area, with probably step-faulting
parallel to the strike of the beds; owing to these features there
are developed a series of long ridges, with a flat dip slope
northward and a steeper drop to the south, while the drainage
channels run along the lines of strike and only break across the
ridges at a few points. The drainage from these channels, the chief
of which is called the Wadi Um Khafur, meanders northward over the
plain to join a feeder of Wadi Garara.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Um Harba</span> is a conspicuous
sandstone peak marked by a triangulation beacon in latitude 23° 36′
56″, longitude 34° 30′ 38″. Rising to a height of 688 metres above
sea-level, it forms the highest and central point of a long range
running north-north-west and south-south-east from the Wadi el
Garara past the Galt el Aguz. The north end of this range is
forked, the east and west arms being separated by a broad high
valley, filled with blown sand, draining from near the peak of
Gebel Um Harba northwards to Garara. A marked feature of the range
is the almost constant north-easterly dip of the sandstone beds of
which it is composed; the ridges follow the strike of the beds, and
present gentle dip slopes to the east with steep basset edges to
the west. Gebel Um Harba overlooks to the west a great sandy plain,
so that it is a good landmark for travellers coming from that
direction. In occupying it as a station, I approached it by the
broad sandy valley above-mentioned, and fixed the camp at 487
metres above sea-level and 800 metres north of the summit; the hill
can also be reached from the west, though the climb from the plain
is about one hundred metres more. The ascent becomes rather steep
near the top of the hill, but presents no great difficulty. For a
short time after rain, water can be found in pools in the gullies
close to the east of the hill, but owing to the porosity of the
rock these never last long. The Galt el Aguz, nine and a half
kilometres south-south-east of Gebel Um Harba, in a gully on the
east side of the road to Bir Abu Saafa, lasts longer than other
pools in the neighbourhood, but even it only yields supplies within
a few months at most after rain, for the same reason.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span><span class=
"bold">Gebel Um Sididad</span> is a mass of high sandstone hills on
the north side of Wadi Silsila, thirty kilometres east-south-east
of Gebel Um Harba and overlooking the broad and sandy Wadi Naam to
the east. The hill I ascended, one of the highest, was 623 metres
above sea-level and nearly 300 metres above the plain at its foot.
High sandstone hills extend north-westwards from Gebel Um Sididad
to Gebel Zergat Naam, forming the western side of Wadi Naam.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Abraq</span> is a great high sandstone
plateau cut up by gullies into more or less separate hills,
outlined by the Wadis Silsila on the north, Hodein on the south,
Arned on the west, and Abraq on the east. The highest hills of the
mass are probably two peaks close together on its east side, midway
between Bir Abraq and the Wadi Hodein, which rise to 705 and 699
metres above the sea. The principal interest of Gebel Abraq lies in
its forming a collecting ground for the important springs of Abraq
and Abu Saafa, which occur along its eastern and southern feet.
These springs yield constant supplies of excellent water, due to
slow percolation through almost pure siliceous rocks, and are of
great value both to the local Arabs and to the passing travellers.
There are two beacons on Gebel Abraq, one near Bir Abraq and the
other near Abu Saafa springs. The former, a main triangulation
point, is 667 metres above sea-level on a conspicuous ridge in
latitude 23° 25′ 19″, longitude 34° 46′ 48″; while the latter is on
the eastern edge of the plateau, in latitude 23° 18′ 40″, longitude
34° 48′ 30″, and 639 metres above the sea. The eastern and southern
slopes of the plateau are very steep, becoming almost precipices at
many points, and are the home of many conies and rock partridges,
but one can ascend by taking advantage of the frequent gullies
which cut up the mass. The climb to either beacon from the plain is
about 330 metres, and free from serious difficulty.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Hodein</span> is a high sandstone
plateau forming the south-east continuation of the Abraq mass, from
which it is separated by the ravine of Wadi Hodein. To the south it
is cut off by Wadi Dif. A triangulation beacon near the north-east
point of the plateau in latitude 23° 16′ 20″, longitude 34° 53′
25″, is 695 metres above sea-level, but further west the summits
are rather higher. An extremely steep pass, practicable only on
foot, exists to the south of the mass, leading from the Wadi Gihab
into Wadi Dif, and forming a short cut from Abu Saafa Springs to
Bir Dif, but camels have to go round the east spurs of the
mountain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span><span class=
"bold">Gebel Dif</span> and <span class="bold">Gebel Anfeib</span>
together form a still further continuation south-eastward of the
same great sandstone plateau, being separated from Gebel Hodein by
the deep winding gorge of Wadi Dif. The sandstone beds here dip to
the north-east, and the highest points are near the west edge of
the mass, where they are flanked by lines of lower hills, formed of
schists cropping out from under the sandstone. A triangulation
beacon in latitude 23° 8′ 24″, longitude 34° 59′ 19″, marks the
south end of the high plateau of Gebel Anfeib; it is 705 metres
above sea-level, and very conspicuous from the east, but it is
generally invisible from the west side of the mass, owing to the
ridges north-west of it being slightly higher. In occupying the
point as a station, I approached it from Bir Dif, following up the
Wadi Abu Hashim to its head, then down the Rod Mukrayib round Gebel
Lilowit, the south tip of the schist range, and turning north
across various small wadis to a camp in one of the heads of Wadi
Edunqul, at 315 metres above sea-level and 1,200 metres south-east
of the beacon. This camp could also have been reached from Bir Abu
Saafa via the Wadis Hodein and Anfeib. The climb to the beacon, of
400 metres, is steep, but not difficult, and occupies less than two
hours.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Tibatib</span> is a conspicuous dark
conical peak among the low dark hills which extend from Gebel
Anfeib to Wadi Hodein. Its summit is 396 metres above
sea-level.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Butitelib</span> is a steep-sided
little hill mass of grey felsite close west of the easy pass which
leads from the head of Wadi Abu Hashim into the Rod Mukrayib, near
the south end of Gebel Anfeib. It rises to 485 metres above sea, or
eighty metres above the sandy pass.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Lilowit</span>, the south end of the
schist range which flanks Gebel Anfeib on the west, is 485 metres
above the sea.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Niqrub el Tahtani</span> is a
conspicuous isolated jagged mountain south of the Rod Mukrayib
(which drains its northern face), and west of Wadi Madi. The beacon
on it is in latitude 23° 0′ 39″, longitude 35° 0′ 53″, 829 metres
above sea-level and about 500 metres above the Rod Mukrayib. A
conspicuous pinnacle close north-east of the beacon has practically
the same altitude.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Niqrub el Foqani</span> is a mountain
of granite and felsite rising to a height of 1,078 metres above the
sea, from among the low<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_206">[206]</span> hill country which separates Wadis Madi and
Gemal, in latitude 23° 52′. Its great height and isolated position
render it a conspicuous object in the landscape from great
distances. It is drained by myriads of small wadis radiating in all
directions, but which all eventually join Wadi Madi on the east or
Wadi Gemal on the west. It is best ascended from the west side,
where a camp can be got 1,500 metres due east of the beacon on the
summit and 496 metres above sea-level, in one of the stony heads of
the channels draining towards Wadi Gemal. The ascent from this camp
occupied a little over two hours, and was not very difficult; but
an attempt from any other direction would most likely have failed,
as the slopes to the south and east are extremely steep and in
places precipitous. The top of the mountain is a very rugged ridge,
so broken that it is an hour’s hard work to get along its 700
metres of length. The main ridge is surrounded by lower flanking
peaks on the north, east and south, while from the west there runs
off a long ridge, curving round to the south and enclosing a small
sandy plain south-west of the summit. This curved ridge is cut
through from east to west by a rather steep pass, 490 metres above
sea-level. The view from the summit of Gebel Niqrub el Foqani is
very extensive, as will be seen from the panorama drawn to scale
from theodolite measurements on <a href="#pl16">Plate XVI</a>, but
in the winter months the mountain is frequently wrapped in clouds
for days together; I had to remain eight days on the summit in
December 1907, before I could complete my observations, most of the
time being spent in a cold wet mist which blotted out the
landscape. The beacon on Gebel Niqrub el Foqani, in latitude 22°
51′ 29″, longitude 34° 56′ 49″, marks a point on the administrative
boundary between Egypt and the Sudan, the limit proceeding
east-south-east to Bir Meneiga, and south-south-west to Gebel Um el
Tiur el Foqani.</p>

<p>The low hill country between Gebel Niqrub and Wadi Madi consists
chiefly of east and west ridges formed by dykes. A rather high
granite hill about ten kilometres to the south-east, close to Wadi
Madi, is marked by a beacon and overlooks the well called Bir Madi;
the beacon is 556 metres above sea-level, or eighty metres above
the well.</p>

<p>To the south-west of Gebel Hodein the sandstone runs off in a
mass of very high hills called <span class="bold">Gebel
Kala</span>, leaving a much lower area of schist hills in between,
through which the Wadi Feqoh pursues its<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_207">[207]</span> sandy barren course. Gebel Kala has not
been closely approached, but its principal peaks have been fixed by
triangulation, and the highest is 846 metres above sea-level. The
scarps of these hills are very steep, and the mass appears to be
much cut up by wadis draining to Feqoh. The sandstone ceases just
beyond Gebel Kala, and its place is taken by granite, which forms
the mountains of the watershed further south-west.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Um Reit</span> is a conspicuous granite
mountain rising to 857 metres above sea, seventeen kilometres
south-east of Gebel Awamtib, on the east side of the watershed. It
can be approached either from the west by ascending the tributaries
of Wadi Timsah and crossing the watershed (which is here flat and
sandy) into Wadi el Dreb, or from the east by ascending the Wadi Um
Reit. The best place from which to ascend the mountain is in one of
the heads of Wadi Um Reit, which drains the west side of the mass.
By following this up, a camp can be placed about a kilometre
north-west of the beacon and 520 metres above sea-level. The climb
of 337 metres from the camp is fairly easy, and only occupies about
an hour. From the beacon (latitude 23° 15′ 4″, longitude 34° 34′
17″), a good view is obtainable of the granite peaks to the south,
which forms a complex mass with Aqab el Negum as the highest point;
to the eastward the outlook is mostly over high broken sandstone
plateaux.</p>

<p>Extending south-west from Um Reit is a complex of granite
mountains, which has not been surveyed in detail. The principal
peaks have, however, been fixed by triangulation, and their
positions will be found tabulated in the list of points given in
<a href="#Page_51" class="pginternal">Chapter III.</a> The chief
peaks are <span class="bold">Gebels Etresia</span> (1,037 metres),
<span class="bold">Um Markha</span>, <span class=
"bold">Shigigat</span> (1,023 metres), <span class="bold">Hamrat el
Feg</span>, <span class="bold">Aqab el Negum</span> (1,148 metres),
<span class="bold">Etus</span> (997 metres), and <span class=
"bold">Natetiai</span> (1,164 metres). An important pass is said to
cross the watershed at Aqab el Negum, though quite practicable for
camels, it is a very high pass, whence the name of the mountain,
which signifies “Pass of the Stars.” To the north of Gebel Shigigat
there is a sandy plain from which two conspicuous isolated hills
rise to heights of 901 and 703 metres respectively above sea-level;
these hills appear, however, not to bear any distinctive names.</p>

<p>Further south along the watershed, in latitude 22° 50′, are two
conspicuous peaks of nearly equal height and not far apart, which
from the east look like two hop-kilns. These are called
<span class="bold">Gebel<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_208">[208]</span> Sheyenit</span>. The southern one is the
higher, rising to 887 metres above sea-level, while the northern
one attains 853 metres.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Mishbih</span> is a huge bristling mass
of granite peaks a little east of the main watershed, rising from
the plain west of Wadi Feqoh in latitude 22° 44′. Being much higher
than any other mountain in the neighbourhood, it is a very
remarkable feature for long distances. Though it has not been
surveyed in detail, its chief peaks have been triangulated and the
general shape of its eastern parts is tolerably known by
observations from Niqrub and Korabkansi. The highest of its many
peaks, near the south-west end of the mass, reaches 1,353 metres,
while the north-east peak, marked by a beacon in latitude 22° 44′
18″, longitude 34° 41′ 20″, is 1,316 metres above the sea. The
mountain is believed to be almost entirely drained by feeders of
the Wadi Feqoh.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Shweib</span> is a smaller hill-mass a
little to the south-east of Gebel Mishbih. Its highest peak, which
is at the north-east end, is 914 metres above sea-level.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Shabih</span> is a very remarkable
granite mountain rising abruptly from the sandy plain traversed by
Wadi Feqoh in latitude 22° 45′, about twelve kilometres east of
Gebel Mishbih. From the north, it looks like a very perfect cone,
but as one passes it going south it is seen to be slightly
elongated meridionally, and to have two distinct peaks, of which
the northern and higher one rises to 1,117 metres, or about 650
metres above the plain. Its sides are very steep, and an ascent
would probably be a matter of some difficulty. The Wadi Feqoh
passes close west of the mountain.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Um el Kalala</span> is a small range of
granite peaks close to the east side of Wadi Feqoh in latitude 22°
50′. The peaks at its north and south ends, nearly two kilometres
apart, rise to 672 and 655 metres above sea respectively. In the
low hilly country further north there are three conspicuous little
peaks of dark aspect rising above the general level. <span class=
"bold">Gebel Mismih</span>, the highest of these, rises to 599
metres above the sea; it is a nearly perfect cone twelve kilometres
north of Um el Kalala, and about six kilometres east of Wadi Feqoh.
<span class="bold">Gebel Waqif</span>, nine kilometres
west-north-west of Um el Kalala, is less sharp, and reaches 556
metres above the sea; while the third hill, which is unnamed, lies
nearly between the last two, on the west side of Wadi Feqoh, and
attains only 504 metres.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>To the west of
the Um Harba and Awamtib ranges there is open country, formed by a
great sandy plain, over which the Wadis Ghadrib and Timsah pursue
their northward courses to join Garara, and the monotony of which
is broken at intervals by extensive masses of moderately high
sandstone hills. The principal of these hill masses are Gebels
Nuggur, Mulgata, Ziraga, and the Abu Hashim Hills. <span class=
"bold">Gebel Nuggur</span>, marked by a cairn, lies seventeen
kilometres west of Um Harba, and a little east of the Wadi Timsah;
it forms a detached north-westerly extension of Gebel Dagalai.
<span class="bold">Gebel Mulgata</span> (545 metres) and
<span class="bold">Gebel Ziraga</span> (553 metres), both marked by
triangulation cairns, are the chief members of a long line of
sandstone hills separating the Wadis Timsah and Ghadrib. The
<span class="bold">Abu Hashim Hills</span> extend for great
distances south and west of Bir Abu Hashim; the triangulation
beacon on the hill west of the well in latitude 23° 41′ 44″,
longitude 34° 3′ 33″, is 386 metres above sea, and sixty-six metres
above the wadi floor, but other hills of the group further south
attain higher levels.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Mowisat</span>, seventeen kilometres
south of Gebel Ziraga and a few kilometres west of the Wadi Timsah,
is a granite hill capped by sandstone. It is drained by the Wadi
Mowisat. A track from Aswân to Bir Um Reit passes a little north of
this hill.</p>

<p>Round the heads of the Wadi Ghadrib, about the parallel of 23°
north and the meridian of 34° east, are numerous higher hills, of
which the principal are <span class="bold">Gebels Abu Rahia</span>
(835 metres), <span class="bold">Romit</span>, <span class=
"bold">Baid el Khuruf</span>, <span class="bold">Reietit</span>
(825 metres), <span class="bold">Um Rewat</span>, <span class=
"bold">Um Ghalqa</span>, and <span class="bold">Um Gotto</span>,
while between these and Gebel Mowisat are the <span class=
"bold">Hamiskul Hills</span>. These hills are all composed of
granite, gneiss, and schists, the higher ones, such as Abu Rahia
and Reietit, having sandstone capping the igneous and metamorphic
rocks which build up the main masses. Gebel Um Rewat forms the
divide between the basins of Wadi Kharit and Wadi Alaqi, its
northern parts being drained by the Wadi Reietit, a tributary of
Ghadrib, while the south flanks drain into the Wadi Um Ghalqa, a
feeder of Wadi Seiga.</p>

<p>To the west of Gebel Mishbih there is hilly country, in which
many of the peaks reach considerable heights. The principal
hill-masses in this part are <span class="bold">Gebel el
Naga</span>, a range about four kilometres long running north-west
and south-east, twenty-two kilometres west of Gebel Mishbih, with
several peaks, of which the highest is 827 metres above sea;
<span class="bold">Gebel Seiga</span>, a high hill (905 metres)
about twenty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
kilometres further west, surmounted by a triangulation beacon and
drained by the Wadi Seiga; <span class="bold">Gebel Nesheb
Hasan</span> and <span class="bold">Gebel Abgeya</span>, two hills
west and south-west of Gebel Seiga, between Wadis Seiga and Abu
Had; <span class="bold">Gebel Um Krush</span>, between Wadis Abu
Had and Um Ghalqa; <span class="bold">Gebels Ribdab</span>,
<span class="bold">el Deheis</span>, and <span class="bold">Abu
Brush</span> (810 metres), to the west of Wadi Um Ghalqa; and
<span class="bold">Gebel Kulyeit</span>, a conspicuous cone about
fifteen kilometres south of Gebel Seiga, rising to 724 metres above
sea. Most of these hills are of schists, though Gebels Abu Brush
and Ribdab are of granite.</p>

<h3><a id="c06s07"></a>The Gerf — Korabkansi — Abu Hodeid
Group.</h3>

<p>The central mountains of the Gerf — Korabkansi — Abu Hodeid
group form a compact cluster to the east of the main watershed
between the great eastward draining Wadis Hodein and Ibib. The most
considerable mass in extent is Gebel Gerf, an extremely rugged
mountain tract some twenty kilometres in diameter, having its
highest point 1,419 metres above sea-level. The Abu Hodeid range,
forming a southward extension of the Gerf mass, attains the
somewhat higher level of 1,488 metres; while the detached mass of
Korabkansi on the west rises to 1,230 metres. Besides these main
masses, from which I have named the group, there are numerous
outlying ranges of lesser height, the principal being the Beida
range to the north, and the Hamra Dom range to the east. The main
characteristics of the central group are its extreme ruggedness,
the presence of great masses of serpentine among its constituent
rocks, and a relative abundance of good water supplies. The wells
and springs in the wadis draining from this group of mountains are
among the best and most permanent of the water sources of the
Eastern Desert of Egypt.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Gerf</span> (<em>see</em> map on
<a href="#pl17">Plate XVII</a>) is a mass of rugged mountains,
roughly circular in plan, some twenty kilometres in diameter,
extending between latitudes 22° 35′ and 22° 50′, and between
longitudes 35° 8′ and 35° 20′. Its highest point, marked by a
beacon 1,419 metres above sea-level, is somewhat north of the
centre of the mass, being situated in latitude 22° 42′ 6″ N.,
longitude 35° 12′ 16″ E. Approached from any side, Gerf blocks out
the entire view ahead. The central parts of the mass are entirely
impassable for camels. There is no possible track across it from
north to south, nor is there<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_211">[211]</span> any east to west pass across it north of
the Sherefa Pass (which skirts its south end) except by the heads
of Wadi Shellal. The northern part of the mass, which is
semi-detached by the passes in the heads of Wadi Shellal
above-mentioned, is sometimes called <span class="bold">Gebel
Meneiga</span> or <span class="bold">Gebel Korbiai</span> after the
important water sources of the same name in the wadis draining from
it; and the north-eastern peaks are sometimes called <span class=
"bold">Gebel Muqur</span> from the spring Bir Muqur. But these
names are, I am told, quite local, and the entire mass is usually
known to the Arabs as Gebel Gerf. This application of a single name
to an entire group of mountains, with scores of separate peaks,
extending over about 500 square kilometres, is very unusual,
especially when, as in this case, it is drained by wadis containing
good wells and plenty of vegetation. The explanation given to me by
the guides was quite comprehensible; they stated that Gerf was the
only mountain mass in that part of the desert which was so
extensive in every direction as to prevent them getting a clear
idea of its true shape in their wanderings over it. They can get
all round it only by a rough journey of several days, and any
endeavour to cross its main portion met with failure, so that they
had perforce to regard it as a single great mass, of the true
structure of which they could form no satisfactory notion. The
immense interest which the guides took in the mapping of this
particular mountain tract fully confirmed the explanation given.
The mapping was accomplished by making an entire circuit of the
mass, and ascending a few of the principal summits.</p>

<p>The highest point of Gebel Gerf had been singled out as a
triangulation station from far to the north, while approaching the
mass from the Wadi Hodein. It was eventually reached from the west
side after leaving Gebel Korabkansi, the approach being made by
ascending the Wadi Eirahimib, and going over the pass at its head
(830 metres) into one of the heads of Wadi Um Reddam, turning round
a spur and ascending another of the heads of the same wadi. The
camp, placed as high up the wadi as possible, lay about 1,500
metres west of the beacon, at an altitude of 820 metres. The climb
of nearly 600 metres to the summit occupied three and a quarter
hours, and was free from serious difficulty, though involving some
tiresome traversing of connecting ridges. The summit of Gebel Gerf
is often wrapped in clouds for weeks together in winter, and cold
northerly gales are prevalent.<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_212">[212]</span> I found it necessary to remain on the
summit for no less than twenty-one days and nights in January 1907,
in order to obtain the observations necessary, and the discomfort
due to enforced inaction and piercingly cold winds was
considerable. The top of the mountain is a narrow ridge on which
there is barely standing room for an instrument, but about 100
metres southward along the ridge from the beacon there is a slight
broadening where a small tent may be pitched by hitching the ropes
round rocks instead of tent-pegs.</p>

<p>On a clear day, the view from the summit of Gerf is a
magnificent one. The numberless rugged ridges and peaks of the Gerf
mass itself stretch for miles around, and out beyond, in every
direction except to the east, one can see the more distant
mountains. In the north, the most striking features are the distant
spikes of Gebel Faraid, and still further off one may discern the
blunter forms of Gebels Abu Gurdi, Hamata, and Abu Hamamid, 180
kilometres away. To the east is the coast-plain, with the granite
peaks of Gebel Hamra Dom breaking the monotony. To the south-east
one may see the great peaks of the Elba and Shendib mountains, 130
kilometres away, though these are often hidden by mist when
everything else is clear. To the south, one looks out, over the
gneiss boss of Gebel Um Rasein, to the mountains, rising rank
behind rank, of Medarai, Abu Hodeid, Adar Qaqa, and Is; while a
little to the left of the last-named one may see the double-headed
granite mass of Gebel Obkeik in the Sudan, more than 100 kilometres
distant, towering above the intervening Egyptian mountains. The
panorama visible to the south and south-east is shown drawn to
scale from theodolite measurements in the lower figure on <a href=
"#pl16">Plate XVI</a> (p. 206). To the south-west, one can make out
the principal mountains of the Alaqi basin, while to the west the
mountains of Korabkansi, Shabih, and Mishbih are conspicuous
features.</p>

<p>The north portion of the Gerf mass, sometimes called Gebel
Meneiga, is drained by the Wadi Kreiga, which is a tributary of
Wadi Hodein. One of the principal feeders of Wadi Kreiga is the
stony Wadi Meneiga, important as containing perennial springs of
good water, easily accessible to camels. The eastern and southern
parts of the mass are drained by various feeders of Wadi Shab, the
principal of these feeders being Wadi Shellal el Sharqi, Wadi
Muqur, Wadi Baaneit, Wadi Diqdib, and Wadi Sherefa el Sharqi. The
Wadis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span> Muqur,
Baaneit, and Diqdib, all contain wells or springs, that in Wadi
Diqdib being right in the heart of the mountain mass, while the
others are nearer to its periphery. The western flanks of the Gerf
mass are drained by the feeders of Wadis Feqoh and Madi, the
principal being the Wadis Sherefa el Gharbi, Eirahimib, Shellal el
Gharbi, and Korbiai. The Wadi Sherefa el Gharbi is important as
leading to the Sherefa Pass (907 metres) which forms a direct road
from Bir Sararat Seyet to the well of Um Rasein, while Wadi Korbiai
contains an excellent well at its head, easily reached by
camels.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Dreb</span> is a many-peaked mass of
mountains covering some sixty square kilometres, situated
south-west of the Gerf mass, from which it is separated by the
Sherefa Pass. Its highest peak is 1,293 metres above sea, but there
are numerous other peaks of but little inferior altitude. Its
south-western portion looks on to the plain at the head of Wadi
Feqoh, while to the south-east it is separated from Gebel Medarai
by an easy pass leading from the head of Kwat Hewah westwards into
the head of Wadi Kreim, a tributary of Wadi Feqoh. Another pass is
said to exist leading from Wadi Sherefa el Sharqi into the head of
Wadi Dreb, where there is a well called Bir Bint el Dreb.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Medarai</span>, the next mountain mass
to the south-east, is separated from Gebel Dreb by the pass into
Wadi Kreim above referred to, while at its south faces it is
separated from Gebel Abu Hireiq by another pass leading from one of
the heads of Wadi Medarai westwards into the Wadi Kirwau, a
tributary of Wadi Feqoh. The highest point of Gebel Medarai, marked
by a large cairn, is in latitude 22° 30′ 58″, longitude 35° 12′ 5″,
and rises to 1,299 metres above sea-level. The north faces of the
mass are drained by Kwat Hewah, a tributary of Wadi Shab; the
eastern flanks by Wadi Medarai, a tributary of Wadi Ibib, while the
western faces drain by various feeders into Wadi Feqoh.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Abu Hireiq</span>, the mountain-mass
next south of Medarai, extends eastwards, as a broad tract of many
high ridges, almost to the gneiss-boss of Um Rasein, while to the
south it is united with Gebel Abu Hodeid. The highest point of Abu
Hireiq is 1,319 metres above sea. Its eastern flanks are drained by
tributaries of Wadi Ibib, while the western parts drain into Wadi
Feqoh.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Abu Hodeid</span>, which forms a higher
southward extension<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
of Gebel Abu Hireiq, is really two ranges with the Wadi Abu Hodeid
draining between them. The western range is the higher, its summit,
marked by a beacon in latitude 22° 23′ 18″, longitude 35° 14′ 9″,
being 1,482 metres above sea. The highest point of the eastern
range is 1,256 metres above sea. The south termination of this
eastern range is a very conspicuous rounded peak of granite, 992
metres above sea, called <span class="bold">Abu Hodeid Ogla</span>,
which forms a good landmark for travellers in making the wells of
Abu Hodeid; the wells lie west of this peak. The south parts of the
Abu Hodeid mountains are drained by the Wadis Shinai, Delawet, and
Abu Hodeid, all feeders of Wadi Hasium, and all leading to
important water sources. The eastern faces are drained by Wadis Abu
Hireiq and Tikraneib, which are likewise feeders of Hasium, while
the western flanks are drained by feeders of Wadi Feqoh. The broad
opening where Wadi Hasium passes to the south of the range makes a
natural division separating the mountains of Abu Hodeid from those
of the Adar Qaqa group.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Mansur Diab</span>, a dark mountain,
1,091 metres high, lying six kilometres west of Gebel Abu Hodeid,
is not often visible from the east, being hidden by the higher
ranges in front of it; but it forms a conspicuous landmark to any
one approaching from the west.</p>

<p>To the south of Gebel Mansur Diab, between the heads of Wadi
Feqoh and Wadi Hasium, are some other mountains of considerable
height, the positions of whose summits were fixed by triangulation,
but which were not closely approached. These are <span class=
"bold">Gebel Hadal Derqa</span> (1,108 metres), which as seen from
the north appeared like a hog-backed dark ridge with a conical
semi-detached hill at its south-east end; and <span class=
"bold">Gebel Hilwit Hasium</span>, which appeared to consist of two
separate peaks some three and a half kilometres apart, the higher
or north-east one rising to 1,037 metres, the south-west one to 952
metres above sea.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Korabkansi</span> is a rugged mass of
dark serpentine peaks and ridges occupying a nearly isolated
position some twenty kilometres west of Gebel Gerf. Its highest
point, marked by a triangulation beacon, is situated in latitude
22° 39′ 16″, longitude 34° 59′ 55″, and rises to 1,230 metres above
sea. The main mass is flanked by lower hills to the north and
south, but is more open to the east and west. It is drained
entirely by feeders of Wadi Feqoh, the most important<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span> of these being the Wadi Gemal.
The upper portion of Wadi Gemal is called Wadi Seyet, and is
important as containing a well, Bir Sararat Seyet; the well is
about five kilometres north-east of the main peak, at a place where
the wadi cuts through the flanking hill range. For the ascent of
the mountain, it is best to turn westward from near the well, and
follow up one of the tributaries of Wadi Seyet which leads right
into the heart of the mountain; here a camp can be pitched at 765
metres above sea-level, and the ascent of 465 metres to the summit,
from which there is a grand view, can be accomplished in less than
two hours. The ascent and descent require some care, owing to the
steepness of the slopes (the observed depression angle from summit
to camp was 29¼°) and the rottenness of the rock, which comes away
in lumps at a touch. The accumulated debris, consisting of small
fragments of serpentine, sets at just the angle of repose, so that
in coming down one can stick one’s feet firmly in the mass and
slide down with it for a hundred metres or more without exertion,
taking care only not to be shot over a sudden drop of the face. The
rocks are highly magnetic, and the compass is much disturbed
anywhere on or about the mountain. The mass of high hills which
forms the southward extension of Korabkansi, with peaks and ridges
rising to over 900 metres above sea-level, is called <span class=
"bold">Gebel Wadhait</span>. It is drained on the north by Wadi
Wadhait, a tributary of Wadi Seyet, and on the west by the Wadi
Kamoyib, a tributary of Wadi Feqoh.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Um Rasein</span> is a triple-headed
gneiss boss rising up boldly among schists to the east of Gebel
Medarai. Its remarkable form and light colour render it a
conspicuous feature to a traveller approaching it from the
north-east, and it is an important landmark for the well, Bir Um
Rasein, which exists in a small wadi at its north foot. The highest
peak of the three, marked by a triangulation beacon in latitude 22°
28′ 12″, longitude 35° 20′ 19″, is 909 metres above sea-level. For
ascending the mountain, it is best to follow up the Wadi Merdiyeb
for a short distance on the west side of the range, and a camp can
be placed at 386 metres above the sea in a small tributary gully
which drains from the main mountain. The climb of 523 metres to the
beacon is steep in places, but can be accomplished in two hours
without difficulty by any one used to negotiating smooth steep
rocks. The top of the mountain is more convenient for observation
than most others in this region, and there is a good view from it.
The beacon is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span> on a
smooth hard granite surface, with plenty of room to walk round an
instrument, while a little to the west there is a good place to
pitch a small tent, and a convenient cave for servants to sleep
in.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Kilia Arib</span>, another isolated granite
mass about six kilometres further east, rises to 647 metres above
sea, and is a landmark for the mouth of Wadi Diqdib, which contains
a well.</p>

<p>To the east and south of Kilia Arib are some smaller granite
hills called Tibashoi. Though rising only some fifty or sixty
metres above the plain, these hills are conspicuous landmarks from
their isolated position. The northern, central, and southern ones
are called respectively <span class="bold">Tibashoi Dumat</span>,
<span class="bold">Tibashoi Tumalhoi</span>, and <span class=
"bold">Tibashoi Tomakolat</span>. Another hill of similar size and
character, five kilometres north-north-east of Kilia Arib, is
called <span class="bold">Tuquqî</span>.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Qrein Salama</span> is a little group of
diorite hills rising from the coast-plain to the east of Gebel
Gerf. The highest hill of the group, 354 metres above sea, forms a
conspicuous landmark which is visible for long distances.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Berget Abu Sarib</span> is a tract of low
dark hills, with much drifted sand, lying a few kilometres
north-east of Qrein Salama.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gimeida</span>, a small but conspicuous black
conical hill, rising to sixty metres above the coast-plain, or 123
metres above sea-level, is important as a landmark for ships
entering Mersa Shab. A triangulation beacon has been erected on the
summit, the position of which is latitude 22° 46′ 29″, longitude
35° 37′ 49″. The azimuth from the beacon to the big tree at Mersa
Shab is N. 62½° E. A much lower dolerite ridge, two kilometres east
of Gimeida, is called <span class="bold">Umarawi</span>.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Hamra Dom</span> is a range of
remarkable red granite hills rising abruptly from the coast-plain
near latitude 22° 40′ and longitude 35° 40′. The range has a total
length from north to south of about eleven kilometres, the highest
peak being near the centre of the range. A beacon on this highest
peak has the position latitude 22° 39′ 6″, longitude 35° 38′ 42″,
altitude 389 metres above sea. Care is necessary in sighting this
peak, for there are two others near it of nearly equal height; the
beacon is on the southernmost one of the three peaks near the
centre of the range. A pass leads across the range a kilometre
south of the beacon. Gebel Hamra Dom is a locality well known to
the Arabs, in consequence of its being occasionally favoured with
some rainfall. In January 1907 the district round the mountain was
covered with grass after a recent fall of rain, but the
hundreds<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span> of camels
and other animals which the Arabs took to graze at the place had
eaten it all up when I arrived there in February. At times of
rainfall there is water to be got in the sandy bed of a little wadi
to the north of the beacon, at a place called Ti Dabei Hamra Dom;
but it does not last long after rain. Gebel Hamra Dom is drained
almost entirely by feeders of Wadi Ibib.</p>

<p>There are numerous smaller hills to the west of Gebel Hamra Dom,
but only the largest of them, <span class="bold">Tibansi Tikam
Ankwei</span>, bears a special name. This is a granite hill rising
to 345 metres above sea-level, situated eleven kilometres due west
of the beacon on Gebel Hamra Dom.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Khashab</span> and <span class=
"bold">Gebel Beidâ</span> together form a complex range of high
hills mostly composed of schists to the north of Gebel Gerf. The
range has its long axis north-west and south-east, with a length of
some twenty-five kilometres and an average breadth of about eight
kilometres. The highest point of the range is marked by a
triangulation beacon on Gebel Beidâ, 715 metres above sea-level, in
latitude 23° 0′ 14″, longitude 35° 16′ 54″. The north-west part of
the range is drained by the heads of Wadi Khashab, a tributary of
Wadi Hodein. The eastern faces are drained by the Wadi Beidâ and
various other feeders of Wadi Hodein, while the south and
south-west portions of the mass are drained by small tributaries of
Wadi Kreiga, itself a tributary of Wadi Hodein. So far as I know,
the range can only be crossed by camels at one place, near the
centre of its length, where it is cut through by the Wadi Beidâ;
coming from the west, one must make for the pass (395 metres above
sea, stony but not steep) which separates the heads of Wadi Khashab
and Wadi Beidâ; the road is well known as leading to the well
called Bir Beidâ.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Humariai</span> is an isolated hill,
563 metres above sea, a few kilometres to the west of Gebel
Beidâ.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Kolaiqo</span> is a small hill-mass
lying off the south-eastern extremity of the Khashab — Beidâ range,
from which it is separated by the Wadi Kreiga. Its highest point,
marked by a triangulation beacon, is in latitude 22° 54′ 13″,
longitude 35° 24′ 34″, at an altitude of 320 metres above
sea-level. The drainage is mostly into Wadi Kreiga, but the
south-eastern parts of the hills drain into Wadi Kolaiqo, a very
shallow ill-defined drainage line coursing independently to sea
across the sandy coast-plain. To the north of Gebel Kolaiqo there
are two long lines of low hills forming low outliers of Nubian
sandstone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span><span class=
"bold">Ti Qireira</span> is the name given to two low hills rising
from the coast-plain about half-way between Gebel Kolaiqo and the
black conical hill of Gemeida. These hills, four kilometres apart,
rise only some fifty or sixty metres above the plain, but they are
conspicuous landmarks, and hence bear a name.</p>

<h3><a id="c06s08"></a>The Meisah — Adar Qaqa — Is Group.</h3>

<p>The Meisah — Adar Qaqa — Is group of mountains extends
northwards from the Sudan frontier in longitude 35½°. It is
separated from the Gerf — Abu Hodeid masses to the north by the
Wadi Hasium; on the east, the great Wadi Di-ib divides it from the
mountains of the Elba group; while to the west it is not sharply
marked off from the rather lower mountainous tract of the upper
Alaqi basin. Gebels Adar Qaqa (1,469 metres) and Is (1,736 metres)
are on the main watershed, while Hadal Aweib Meisah (1,224 metres)
forms the highest point of a huge rugged spur running northwards on
the east side of the watershed. To the east of the main mountains
of the group, between them and the Wadi Di-ib, are a number of
detached mountain and hill-masses, of which the principal are
Gebels O Shakafa, Um Ein, Qara Saba, Warabeit, Adar Aweib, and
Shiab.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Hadal Aweib Meisah</span> is a conspicuous
double-topped mountain of a somewhat conical shape. Its summit,
marked by a triangulation beacon, is 1,224 metres above sea-level,
and has the position latitude 22° 16′ 39″, longitude 35° 31′ 55″.
In plan it is almost circular, three-fourths of the circumference
of its base being formed by the Wadis Awitla and Lasewid (feeders
of Wadi Meisah), while the remaining fourth forms a connexion by
which the mountain is joined to the long ridge of Gebel Qidmib. The
ascent of the mountain was made from a camp one and three-quarter
kilometres due east of the summit, in a small feeder of Wadi
Lasewid, close to the spring called Megwel Um Edwa. Camels cannot
get quite up to the spring, but a camp can be placed a little way
further down the gully at an altitude of 596 metres above sea, and
the climb of 628 metres to the top of the mountain is easily
accomplished on foot in about two hours. The mountain is composed
of dark gabbroid rock, the summit being composed of great blocks,
weathered to a rusty brown on their surfaces; the rock is highly
magnetic, and the compass points several degrees east of north at
the beacon owing to local attraction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span><span class=
"bold">Iarih Meisah</span> is the name given to a tract of low
granite hills with sandy interspaces, which lies to the south of
Hadal Aweib Meisah. It forms the head of Wadi Baueiwai.</p>

<p>About three kilometres west of Hadal Aweib Meisah, a high ridge,
over 1,000 metres in height, courses north and south for over
fourteen kilometres. The north end of this ridge bifurcates to form
<span class="bold">Gebel Qidmib</span>; the Wadi Qidmib, draining
northwards to Wadi Ibib, has its head between the two branches of
the ridge, where there is a well called Bir Qidmib.</p>

<p><span class="bold">O Shakafa</span> is a very remarkable hill
seven kilometres north-east of Hadal Aweib Meisah. O Shakafa
derives its name, which signifies “the barrier,” from the fact that
it appears to block the way to the traveller ascending the Wadi
Meisah. Its crest, formed by a ridge of hard jaspery quartzite,
rises precipitously from among a mass of softer rocks, some of
which show remarkably brilliant colours due to iron staining. The
cairn on the summit is in latitude 22° 19′ 44″, longitude 35° 34′
42″, and 751 metres above sea-level. There is barely standing room
on the top of the ridge, which needs careful climbing owing to its
precipitous nature. O Shakafa is a good landmark for Bir Meisah,
which lies in the wadi about three kilometres north-east of the
summit; and for the easy pass of Sarob Kwan, which lies four
kilometres to the south-east.</p>

<p>To the north of O Shakafa there extends a great tract of high
hills, divided into two portions by the northward-coursing Wadi
Orgem. The western portion of this hill-tract culminates in
<span class="bold">Gebel Orgem</span>, the two peaks of which rise
respectively to 779 and 775 metres above the sea, while its
northern end forms the high sand-swathed hill called <span class=
"bold">Baqari Daba</span>. The eastern portion of the tract,
containing the important wells Bir Um Bishtit and Bir Meisah, as
well as the galts of Meis-heit-ar, is rather more complex, and is
cut into two parts by the Wadi Um Bishtit. Its northern part ends
in a conspicuous gneiss hill called <span class="bold">Adar Aweib
Um Bishtit</span>, while the hills immediately north of O Shakafa
are called <span class="bold">Gebel Meis-heit-ar</span>.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Adar Qaqa</span> is a very conspicuous
granite mountain about twenty-three kilometres west of Hadal Aweib
Meisah. Its highest peak is in latitude 22° 13′ 47″, longitude 35°
19′ 0″, and rises rather precipitously to 1,606 metres above
sea-level. Adar Qaqa is drained principally by the Wadi Hasium,
which courses northward past the western side of the mountain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span><span class=
"bold">Gebel Soaorib</span> is a rather long mountain range which
adjoins the south part of Adar Qaqa and sweeps round to the
south-east, forming the main watershed. Its highest point is 1,469
metres above sea-level. Its north-western face is drained by Wadi
Mantil Hasium, which forms one of the heads of Wadi Hasium. The
north-eastern flanks are drained by the Wadi Haiyo and other
feeders of Wadi Soaorib, while the south-west faces drain into the
Wadi Kirir and the Miti-Kwan, tributaries of Wadi Alaqi.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Leqaq</span> (1,192 metres) and
<span class="bold">Gebel Um Seleim</span> (1,098 metres) are two
mountains, both with long northward spurs, lying north-east of Adar
Qaqa, between that mountain and the Wadi Soaorib. They are drained
by various feeders of the Wadis Hasium and Soaorib, the principal
being the Rod Anut Berer, which runs northward from between two
mountains to join Wadi Hasium, and the Wadi Hankuk, which rises to
the south of Gebel Leqaq and courses round the south-east flanks to
join Wadi Soaorib.</p>

<p>To the north of Gebels Leqaq and Um Seleim there stretches a
sandy plain, over which the Wadis Hasium, Ibib, and Soaorib pursue
their northward course. Low hills rise here and there from this
plain, the most conspicuous being <span class="bold">Gebel Hamra
Tit</span>, a double-peaked granite hill, rising to 642 metres
above the sea; <span class="bold">Kulet Meigrum</span> and
<span class="bold">Kulet Tinasal</span> are two somewhat smaller
hills situated respectively six kilometres north-north-east and six
kilometres east-north-east from Gebel Hamra Tit.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Is</span>, the next great mountain to
the south, forms the main watershed just north of the Sudan
frontier, the triangulation cairn on its summit having the position
latitude 22° 2′ 36″, longitude 35° 28′ 4″, altitude 1,736 metres
above sea. As seen from the north, Gebel Is is a somewhat
flat-topped mountain of dark aspect; but judging by analogy the
apparent flat top is probably only a narrow ridge seen broadside
on. From the main mass a long spur of flanking mountains runs
westward, and a high ridge, more or less detached, rises to 1,474
metres six kilometres south-east of the main summit. The northern
and western faces of Gebel Is are drained by feeders of Wadi Alaqi,
while its eastern and southern parts are drained by various heads
of Wadi Is.</p>

<p>Between Hadal Aweib Meisah and Gebel Is there stretches a mass
of mountains with many peaks over 1,200 metres high;
these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span> appear to
bear no special names. My guides stated that there are two passes
over the main watershed in this region. The first, called
<span class="bold">Adar Ameit</span>, is a high pass practicable
for camels; it lies about four kilometres to the north of the
beacon on Gebel Is, and connects the two Wadis Adar Ameit el Sharqi
and Adar Ameit el Gharbi which lie on opposite sides of the
watershed. The second pass, said to be a difficult one, crosses the
watershed some five kilometres further north, forming a connexion
between the heads of Miti Kwan and Wadi Soaorib.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Miatit</span> (1,257 metres) and
<span class="bold">Gebel Suruk</span> (1,377 metres), are mountain
masses a little east of, and semi-detached from, the main Is group.
Gebel Miatit sends out a long spur north-eastward, ending in a
rather conspicuous hill at the foot of which there is said to be a
water source called Megwel Aqwem.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Shiab</span> is a collection of peaks
rising from a rugged country of lower hills about twenty-eight
kilometres east of Gebel Is. Its highest point is 987 metres above
sea-level. Gebel Shiab appears to form the main head of Wadi el
Qurat, an important feeder of Wadi Di-ib.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Eqrun</span> (the horns) is a conspicuous
group of schist hills lying between the Wadis Meisah and Ibib. It
has two principal peaks; the higher one, surmounted by a
triangulation beacon, has the position latitude 22° 30′ 10″,
longitude 35° 37′ 9″, and is 473 metres above sea-level; the other
is about 400 metres south-east of the beacon, and is only five
metres lower. Eqrun itself is an isolated hill group, but close to
the north-east of it there is another hill-mass of greater extent
and of but little inferior height.</p>

<p>The country south of Eqrun forms an extensive tract of low hills
with much blown sand. Two conspicuous hills in this tract rise
above the rest and bear special names; these are <span class=
"bold">Tahaqayet</span> (432 metres) and <span class=
"bold">Titailibab</span> (593 metres).</p>

<p><span class="bold">Kolmanab</span> and <span class=
"bold">Einiwai</span> are two small but very conspicuous black
hills eleven kilometres apart, rising from the sandy coast-plain
between the Wadis Meisah and Di-ib. Both are surmounted by
triangulation beacons, that on Kolmanab being in latitude 22° 32′
26″, longitude 35° 53′ 36″, 137 metres above sea, and that on
Einiwai being in latitude 22° 27′ 50″, longitude 35° 57′ 59″, 138
metres above sea. North-west of Kolmanab are some low banks called
<span class="bold">Tinadei</span>, while about mid-way between
Kolmanab and Einiwai is an isolated low hill called <span class=
"bold">Ankalidot</span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span><span class=
"bold">Osnei</span> is a small but conspicuous red granite hill,
rising to 251 metres above sea, thirteen kilometres west-south-west
from Einiwai. It contains a galt, which yields water for some
little time after rain has fallen locally.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Ti Keferiai</span> is a conspicuous little
isolated group of dark hills of no very great height, situated in
the fork where the Wadis Didaut and Baueiwai join to form the Wad
el Qireira. There are heavy accumulations of blown sand round the
north-east flanks of the mass. The triangulation beacon on the
summit has the position latitude 22° 21′ 0″, longitude 35° 49′ 47″,
and is 494 metres above sea-level. Ti Keferiai forms a good
landmark for the old mines of Romit, which are situated in some
lower hills five kilometres south-west of the beacon. There are
numerous excavations here in veins of smoky quartz with calcite and
chalybite, which penetrate the country rock of highly crushed and
decomposed diorite; a number of ancient grinding mills of diorite
lie scattered about the place.</p>

<p>Four kilometres north of Ti Keferiai, on the opposite side of
Wadi Didaut, is a conspicuous hill of very red granite called
<span class="bold">Adatalob Adara</span>, 385 metres above
sea-level. Four kilometres further north-west is another hill, of
nearly equal height, but of black aspect, called <span class=
"bold">Adatalob Hadal</span>. West of Ti Keferiai, at distances of
five and a half and nine and a half kilometres respectively, are
two conspicuous little hills rising from the plain, one on either
side of the Wadi Didaut; these are called <span class=
"bold">Kikeiyet Sharqi</span> and <span class="bold">Kikeiyet
Gharbi</span>.</p>

<p>East of Ti Keferiai is a great sandy tract stretching to the
Wadi Di-ib, from which low hills rise half swathed in blown sand;
the principal hill groups bear the names of <span class=
"bold">Gebels Tishushi</span> and <span class="bold">Tishushi
Tiboki</span>.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Qara Saba</span> is a high and steep hill
mass of dark aspect, rising conspicuously to 788 metres above sea,
between the Wadis Didaut and Baueiwai, some sixteen kilometres
south-west of Ti Keferiai. The tract between Qara Saba and Ti
Keferiai is a waste of blown sand through which low hills protrude
in places.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Adar Aqdeib</span>, a granite hill 736 metres
high on the north side of the Wadi Didaut, about half-way between
Qara Saba and O Shakafa, is a landmark for two small water sources
and a pass. The first of these water sources, Megwel Adar Aqdeib,
is on the east side of the hill, in a little tributary of Wadi
Didaut. The second,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
Megwel Didaut, is at the head of Wadi Didaut itself, in a separate
rugged hill tract south of Adar Aqdeib. The west faces of Adar
Aqdeib are drained by the Sarob Kwan, half of which courses
south-east to Wadi Didaut, and half north-west to Wadi Meisah, and
the divide forms a well known easy pass.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Um Ein</span> is a huge hill-mass of
dark rocks, rising to 901 metres above sea-level, nine kilometres
south-south-west of Qara Saba. The beacon which marks the summit is
in latitude 22° 11′ 52″, longitude 35° 39′ 4″. Gebel Um Ein is
mainly drained by the Wadi Baueiwai, which curves round the south
half of its circumference. A small water source, Megwel Um Ein, is
said to exist on the north-east side of the hill, in a small wadi
which forms a tributary of Wadi Baueiwai.</p>

<p>A great tract of high hills lies between the Wadis Baueiwai and
Di-ib. The northern part of the tract, which is cut off from the
rest by the Wadi Warabeit, and is called <span class="bold">Gebel
Geror</span>, has several peaks rising to over 500 metres; on the
north it is flanked by huge accumulations of blown sand, while its
southern faces are drained by fairly well-wooded wadis, tributaries
of Wadi Warabeit. The part of the hill tract south of the Wadi
Baueiwai is much cut up by wadis into masses which bear separate
names. <span class="bold">Gebel Hamida</span>, which with
<span class="bold">Gebel Nubitra</span> forms the westernmost
hill-mass of the group, is a series of high steep schist ridges
rising in places over 700 metres above sea-level. The highest
point, 754 metres above sea, is best reached by following up the
Wadi Hamida till one comes due west of the hill, and then striking
up eastwards on foot; it can also be reached from the east side
<em>via</em> the tiny trickling salt spring of Megwel Hamida, but I
found this a long and wearisome climb. To the north-east of Gebel
Hamida is the pass called Bani Sana, which is important both as a
pass and as being the boundary between the territories of the
Kurbeilab and Hamedorab Arabs. <span class="bold">Gebel
Warabeit</span>, the part of the tract which forms the head of the
Wadi Warabeit, lies south-east of Gebel Hamida, being connected
with Gebel Hamida on the one side and Gebel Mashushenai on the
other; its highest point is 794 metres above sea-level.
<span class="bold">Gebel Mashushenai</span> (634 metres) lies a
little to the east of Gebel Warabeit; its north parts are drained
by the Wadi Hashimaiyib, while the south portions are drained by
Wadi Mashushenai, in the head of which is a well, Bir Mashushenai.
All the drainage from hereabouts ultimately reaches Wadi Di-ib by
way<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span> of Wadi el
Qurat. <span class="bold">Adar Aweib</span>, a conspicuous and
extensive granite hill-mass lying east of the foregoing, from which
it is entirely separated by wadis, rises to 620 metres above sea;
its summit is marked by a triangulation beacon in latitude 22° 10′
50″, longitude 35° 54′ 0″. In occupying Adar Aweib as a station, it
was approached from the Bani Sana pass by following down the Wadi
Warabeit and then turning up the Wadi Wieqwer, which leads to the
eastern foot of the mountain. The camp was placed about a kilometre
north-west of the beacon, at an altitude of 284 metres above sea,
and the climb of 336 metres to the top took only an hour and a
half. A great variety of flowers could be gathered in the lower
part of the ascent; the upper portion was slippery, the slopes
consisting of debris of decomposed granite resting just at the
angle of repose. In descending from the mountain, I went northwards
on foot, whence a steep pass led down to Bir Meheriqa, in the Wadi
Di-ib; but the camels had to go round the south end of the mountain
by Wadi el Qurat, as the pass was too steep for them.</p>

<p>To the south of the group of hills just described, there is a
rugged tract of low hills stretching away south to Gebel Shiab.
Eastwards this tract becomes lower and more sandy, terminating in a
sandy plain with low rocky ridges, over which the Wadi Di-ib
pursues its northward course, becoming closed in again by hills
abreast of Adar Aweib.</p>

<h3><a id="c06s09"></a>The Mountains of the Alaqi Basin West of
Adar Qaqa.</h3>

<p>The mountains of this group, which are scattered over an area of
some 5,000 square kilometres between latitudes 22° 0′ and 22° 22′,
and longitudes 34° 0′ and 35° 20′, are comparatively little known.
The positions and heights of all the principal peaks have been
fixed by triangulation from considerable distances; but with the
single exception of Gebel Muqsim, which was occupied by Mr.
Villiers Stuart as his terminal point, none of the area has yet
been officially surveyed.</p>

<p>The positions determined for the principal peaks will be found
included in the list on <a href="#Page_51" class="pginternal">pp.
51</a> to 64, and a general idea of the relative positions of the
mountains and drainage lines will be obtained from the orographical
map on <a href="#pl01">Plate I.</a> A brief reference only to the
principal mountains is possible here.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Anweiyib</span> (921 metres) and
<span class="bold">Eir Arib</span> (1,112 metres) are<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span> on the main watershed. As seen
from the north, the former appeared as a long dark range, the
latter as a light-coloured high short ridge with a peak at its
western end.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebels Duag</span> (1,328 metres) and
<span class="bold">Himeitra</span> (1,231 metres) are connected
with the watershed range of Adar Qaqa and Is by westward-running
spurs. Gebel Himeitra is a landmark for a well, Bir Himeitra, which
is situated a little south of the mountain, and also for the ruins
of Darahib, which lie in the Wadi Alaqi some twelve kilometres
south-south-west of it.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Heianai</span> (1,256 metres) is a long
range of mountains between the Wadis Bint el Feqoh and Defeit.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Heleikonti</span> (1,151 metres)
appeared from the north as a short high steep ridge with a little
peak at its western end.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Egat</span>, one of the best known and
most remarkable of the mountains of the group, is a high steep cone
rising to 1,145 metres above sea on the north side of the Wadi
Alaqi in latitude 22° 5′ 39″, longitude 34° 52′ 15″. It is a
landmark for Bir Egat, which lies about five kilometres to the
east, and for the mines of Alfawi, which lie some ten kilometres
south-east of the peak.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Shanaiyet</span> (907 metres) and
<span class="bold">Gebel Hamida</span> lie south of the Wadi
Defeit, between that wadi and the Wadi Egat.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Hateib</span> or <span class=
"bold">Suhin</span> (854 metres) forms the main collecting ground
for the Wadis Hateib and Suhin, which are tributaries of Alaqi.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Um el Tiur el Foqani</span> is a group
of very high steep hills on the south side of Wadi Defeit. It has a
well-marked peak as its summit, in latitude 22° 17′ 56″, longitude
34° 41′ 14″, 946 metres above sea-level. This peak forms a point on
the administrative boundary between Egypt and the Sudan.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Um el Tiur el Tahtani</span>, situated
some twelve kilometres west-north-west of the foregoing, and on the
opposite side of the Wadi Defeit, is a somewhat similar but lower
group of hills, its highest point rising to 783 metres above
sea.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel el Adraq</span> (770 metres) and
<span class="bold">Gebel Guqub</span> are two other hill-groups
south of Gebel Um el Tiur el Tahtani, lying between the Wadis
Defeit and Alaqi. Gebel el Adraq is a landmark for some old mines
called Betan, while Gebel Guqub is the collecting ground, the
drainage of which supplies the important well of Bir Guqub.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span><span class=
"bold">Gebel Muqsim</span> is a conspicuous mountain on the south
side of the Wadi Alaqi near the meridian of 34°. The triangulation
cairn on its summit is in latitude 22° 10′ 11″, longitude 34° 1′
12″, at an altitude of 825 metres above sea-level. Gebel Muqsim
forms a point on the administrative boundary between Egypt and the
Sudan.</p>

<h3><a id="c06s10"></a>The Elba-Shendib Group.</h3>

<p>This group of granite mountains is situated near the sea in the
extreme south-east corner of Egypt, between longitudes 36° and 37°,
on and about the parallel of 22° of north latitude. Part of the
group, including the highest peak (Asotriba, 2,216 metres) is in
the Sudan, and we shall here consider only the northern parts,
which fall within Egypt proper. The principal mountains of the
group are Gebels Elba (1,428 metres), Shendib (1,912 metres),
Hanquf (1,465 metres), Shendodai (1,529 metres), and Shellal (1,409
metres). Besides these, which form a cluster of high rugged ridges
and bristling peaks, there are some outlying hills to the east and
west, and it is convenient to consider all the hills east of Wadi
Di-ib as belonging to the group. The principal of these outlying
hills are Gebels Balatitda, Sul Hamid (572 metres), Qash Amir (724
metres), and Sela (560 metres) on the west, and Karam Elba (586
metres) and Gebel Hadarba (217 metres) on the east of the main
masses. The general relations of the Elba district will be seen
from the orographical map on <a href="#pl01">Plate I,</a> while the
large scale map on <a href="#pl19">Plate XIX</a> shows the detailed
features on a larger scale.</p>

<p>Towering to great heights from the coast-plain, the mountains of
the Elba group are very conspicuous from long distances either on
sea or on land when the air is clear. But often for weeks together
they are so shrouded in mist as to be invisible even when one is
fairly near to them. These very mists, which so often hinder the
view being obtained, are the cause of much added beauty to the
scene when the air is clear; for the moisture produces a rich
vegetation, not only in the wadis, but along all clefts right up to
the tops of the mountains, and furnishes in addition the largest
and most important water sources in the Eastern Desert. So abundant
is the vegetation in all the wadis draining from Elba, that it is
impossible to approach the mountains very closely with loaded
camels, owing to the closeness of the trees. Richest in water
supply and in vegetation of all tracts in the Eastern<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span> Desert of Egypt, it is natural
that the Elba district should also be the greatest centre of desert
population, and there are considerable settlements of Bisharin
Arabs round the feet of the mountains.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Elba</span>,<a id=
"FNanchor_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111" class=
"fnanchor">[111]</a> the most northerly mountain of the main group,
is cut off from the mountains to the south by the Wadis O Sir Hadal
and Serimtai; there is a pass between the heads of these wadis, so
that a complete circuit of the mountain can be made, although from
almost any aspect Elba appears to be joined on to the other
mountains of the group. In plan, Gebel Elba is nearly a square of
about fifteen kilometres sides, with its diagonal in the meridian.
It is a bristling mass of light-coloured granite peaks, flanked on
the south and west by rugged hills of darker rocks. The highest
point, the “high peak” of the Admiralty Chart, is in latitude 22°
10′ 3″, longitude 36° 21′ 52″, and 1,435 metres above sea; another
peak, slightly lower, but more conspicuous and nearer the centre of
the mass, was chosen for the site of the triangulation station. The
beacon on this latter peak is 1,428 metres above sea, and has the
position latitude 22° 11′ 27″, longitude 36° 20′ 52″. The peak
which bears the triangulation station forms a centre from which
drainage lines radiate in all directions. The principal of these
drainage lines, which are all well wooded, are the Wadi Yahameib,
which with its feeders Wadis Akau and Kansisrob drains the north
faces of the mountain, and unites with Wadi Aideib, which drains
the north-east flanks; Wadi Serimtai, which by its feeder the Wadi
O Sir Eirab drains the south part of the mass and then curves round
north-eastwards to the sea; and the Wadi Yoider, which drains the
western parts of the mountain by its three main heads called
respectively Wadi Akwamtra, Wadi Qeirat, and Wadi O Sir Hadal, and
then courses northward to reach the sea.</p>

<p>The approach to Gebel Elba by the coast-plain from the
north-west is said to be difficult, on account of having to cross
an extensive tract of sand dunes, called I Hubal, which lies to the
north and north-east of Gebel Sul Hamid. The survey expedition
reached the mountain by marching eastward from Bir Meheriqa in the
Wadi Di-ib. On this road the sand was not found a serious
hindrance, though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
progress was rather slow through O Harbub, a sand-choked wadi which
was entered on turning eastwards just after leaving Bir Meheriqa.
Skirting the south side of Gebel Sul Hamid over a sandy plain, we
continued eastward with a slight northerly bend till the jagged
mass of Qash Amir came into view; then striking due east again we
entered some low hills and dropped by an easy pass into Wadi
Siamtit, a little feeder of Wadi Yoider; crossing the main channel
of Yoider, we continued our course eastward across very sandy minor
wadis, and turning a little southward we reached Bir Akwamtra,
where we found a fairly large Bisharin camp, in a stony wadi full
of trees.</p>

<p>I had hoped to ascend the mountain by way of Wadi Akwamtra,
which heads right under the peak selected for the triangulation
station. But on arriving at the well we were still more than six
kilometres from the head of the wadi, and further progress for
camels was very difficult owing to the closeness of the trees, and
the bouldery nature of the wadi floor. Guides sent out to
reconnoitre having reported that the ascent could be made with less
difficulty from the Wadi Yahameib, we followed a very winding track
leading over the Asut Duk pass into Yahameib, and then made our way
southward over the sloping bouldery plain, thick with trees and
scrub, until the camels could get no farther. The camp was pitched
in a slight clearing at the foot of the mountain, three and a
quarter kilometres north-west of the beacon, at an altitude of 343
metres above sea, or 1,085 metres below the beacon.</p>

<p>The climb to the summit was a long and tiring one, but very
interesting. Starting at 6.30 a.m. on April 25, 1908, we first
followed up the Wadi Yahameib to its head in a sort of neck between
two peaks; this neck, which we reached at 10 a.m., is 1,093 metres
above sea. About half way up to the neck, among some large granite
blocks, there is a small spring of very pure water; it forms a pool
holding about a gallon and a half, which fills as fast as it is
emptied. Passing over the neck, we dropped down to a level of 984
metres in crossing the head of Wadi Akwamtra, and then, climbing up
the opposite side, we reached the beacon (1,428 metres) at noon.
Except the last 150 metres to the summit, which was bare steep
granite, the whole climb was through a thick growth of trees, very
green and fresh, with a tangled undergrowth of flowering shrubs and
some mosses and lichens. The trees grow very near to the
summit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span> and give
plenty of shady resting-places. Acacia (<em>sellim</em>) trees
cease about 350 metres above sea, and new forms take their place.
The most remarkable is a large tree called <em>Hohait</em> by my
Arabs; this tree, which I have not seen elsewhere in Egypt, grows
in fair abundance to ten metres or more high, with thick woody
looking trunk and branches, the foliage being great bunches of
aloe-like leaves on the ends of the branches; according to my
Arabs, it bears an edible fruit, of which they showed me the
stone—a nearly spherical red one, about as big as a pea, very
hard.<a id="FNanchor_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112" class=
"fnanchor">[112]</a></p>

<p>The top of the mountain is narrow and very rough, but narrow
sleeping places can be found on ledges. The view from the summit in
clear weather is very fine and extensive; the subjoined figure is
from a careful sketch which I made of the outlook southwards from
the beacon. But, as already remarked, the mountain is frequently
shrouded in cloud, and of the ten days I remained on the summit in
April and May 1908 only three were clear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>The phenomenon
of “glories,” or rainbow-coloured rings round the shadow of one’s
head cast on to clouds below when the summit was clear, was well
observed in the mornings. Three rings were specially distinct and
vividly coloured on April 26, and I was able to measure the
diameters with an improvised subtense apparatus; measuring to the
middle of the yellow in each case, I found the diameters of the
rings to be 4½°, 8¾°, and 13°, so that the diameters increase in
arithmetical progression. The shadow cast by one’s head and body
was most distinct when the cloud-bank was most opaque; the rings,
on the other hand, were most brilliant when there was only a thin
film of cloud.</p>

<p>The temperatures experienced on the summit were remarkable for
their range. On April 25, 26, and 27, 1908, the air was still and
full of wet mist, and the days were oppressively hot, while the
nights were also warm and damp. On April 28, a cold north-west wind
set in, which soon cleared the air; but with the clearness came
such a chilling of the air that it was impossible to stand up to
the instruments for observations for more than a few minutes at a
time; one was glad to take shelter behind rocks from the biting
blast, and though we were well within the tropics and the spring
was far advanced, we sat shivering with blankets round us even in
the sunniest and most sheltered spots we could find. The cold
lasted till May 4, when we descended the mountain to be half
roasted in the plains below.</p>

<p>As already remarked, Gebel Elba is well supplied with water
sources. The two chief are Bir Akwamtra and Bir Kansisrob, both
situated on the north side of the mountain. Between them is a small
spring called Megwel Akau. On the south side of the mountain are
two other wells called Bir Salalat O Sir, and Bir Sararat Serimtai.
In times of rainfall there must be scores of rock pools along every
drainage line.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Karam Elba</span> is a granite hill rising to
586 metres above sea, close to the north-east foot of Gebel Elba,
from which it is separated by a narrow wadi. Close north of Karam
Elba are some low granite hills called <span class="bold">Takrat
Riba</span>, while on the south side is another small granite hill
called <span class="bold">Mikeriba</span>.</p>

<p>To the east of Karam Elba are some granite hills which, though
of no great height, are conspicuous owing to their position on
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span> coast-plain,
and being used as landmarks by the local Arabs they bear special
names. These are: <span class="bold">Alafot</span>, <span class=
"bold">Taar Ara</span>, <span class="bold">Kreishim</span>,
<span class="bold">Abai Sis</span>, and <span class="bold">O
Wota</span>, the last-named being the largest of them all. Some low
banks north of Alafot are called <span class="bold">Alafot
Onqwab</span>.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Qash Amir</span> (“Scragged Hill” of the
Admiralty Charts) is an isolated hill rising abruptly from a sandy
plain at the head of Wadi Eikwan, about fifteen kilometres
west-north-west of Gebel Elba. Qash Amir well deserves the title
given to it by the Admiralty surveyors, for it is a mass of sharp
granite spikes which my best guides, skilled climbers though they
were, could only ascend with the greatest difficulty. Its top,
marked by a beacon, is 724 metres above sea-level and has the
position latitude 22° 14′ 31″, longitude 36° 12′ 20″. I had
intended to occupy the summit as a main station, but the guides who
were sent to erect the beacon reported that the summit was so sharp
a spike that there was barely room for a beacon to be built, and
that it would be impossible to set up a theodolite tripod on it,
while there was not even a narrow ledge where one could sleep
within several hundred metres of the summit.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel el Sela</span> is a straggling group of
high rugged granite hills rising from the sandy plain to the
north-east of Qash Amir. The highest of its peaks reaches to 560
metres above sea-level.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Sul Hamid</span> is an extensive tract
of low dark hills, covering some hundred square kilometres or so to
the west of Qash Amir. Its highest peak is 572 metres above sea.
The north part of the tract is drained by the Wadi Di-it, the
eastern part by the Wadi Eikwan, while the southern drainages pass
into a very shallow channel which courses westward over a sandy
plain towards Wadi Di-ib, but becomes choked with sand at O Harbub
before reaching that great trunk wadi.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Balatitda</span> is a group of high
hills lying between Gebel Sul Hamid and the Wadi Di-ib. Its highest
point is 592 metres above sea-level. Bir Meheriqa is situated at
the south-west of the mass, on the east side of Wadi Di-ib. The
north flanks of Gebel Balatitda are swathed in blown sand.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel O Sir Eirab</span> is really the south
part of Gebel Elba; its highest point is 842 metres above sea.
Though its name Eirab means “white,” the mountain is composed of
dark-coloured rocks. The explanation is that the Arabs always give
the names to the wadis first, and the adjacent Wadi O Sir Eirab has
a white sandy floor because<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_232">[232]</span> it drains from the granite mass of Elba;
the mountain is called after the wadi near it.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Hanquf</span> is a range of mountains
some twenty kilometres in length, stretching in a south-easterly
direction to the south of Gebel Elba and separating that mountain
from Gebel Shendib. Its south-eastern portion, containing the
highest peaks, is of granite, while the north-western portion
consists of dark rocks. Its highest point is the northerly one of
two remarkable peaks near the south end of the range, and rises to
1,465 metres, while another summit near the middle of the range
reaches 1,397 metres. The northern part of Gebel Hanquf is drained
by the Wadi O Sir Hadal, a tributary of Wadi Yoider; its eastern
flanks by the Wadi Serimtai; while the western drainage is to the
Wadi Hareitra, which courses from between Gebel Hanquf and Gebel
Shendib westwards to join the Wadi Di-ib.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Shendib</span>, which lies close
south-west of Gebel Hanquf, is a great mass of very high
light-coloured peaks flanked on the west by a tract of moderately
high hills of dark colour. The beacon which marks the highest
point, 1,912 metres above sea, is in latitude 22° 0′ 48″, longitude
36° 16′ 30″. Shendib is the third highest mountain in Egypt proper,
being surpassed in altitude only by El Shayeb and Hamata. Besides
the main peak, there are numerous others exceeding 1,600 metres in
height; one of these, some two kilometres south-east of the
principal summit, reaches to 1,863 metres and marks very nearly the
Sudan frontier; its latitude is 21° 59′ 56″, so that it is only
some 120 metres south of the 22nd parallel.</p>

<p>The north portion of Shendib is drained by the Wadi Hareitra,
the south part by Wadi Shendib, both these being tributaries of
Wadi Di-ib.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Shendodai</span> (“Castle Hill” of the
Admiralty Charts) is a high mountain mass lying east of Gebel
Hanquf, from which it is separated by the Wadi Serimtai. Its
highest point, a well-marked peak, is in latitude 22° 3′ 1″,
longitude 36° 25′ 31″, and rises to 1,529 metres above sea-level.
Gebel Shendodai is drained by the Wadis Um Seyal (a tributary of
Wadi Serimtai), Mera Kwan, and Shellal.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Shellal</span>, situated close
south-east of Gebel Shendodai on the Sudan frontier, is a group of
mountains of slightly lower altitude than the foregoing, its
highest peak being 1,409 metres above sea-level. Gebel Shellal is
drained by the Wadis Shellal and Aqilhoq, the latter<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span> containing a good well, called
Bir Frukit. A tract of low foot-hills, some twelve kilometres
broad, fronts Gebels Shendodai and Shellal seawards, leaving a
breadth of some twelve kilometres of gently sloping coast-plain
between them and the shore. One of the foot-hills of Gebel Shellal,
a conspicuous high dark-coloured ridge near Bir Frukit, bears the
name of <span class="bold">Gebel Balatitda</span>. (It will be
noticed that another hill group west of Gebel Elba bears the same
name).</p>

<p><span class="bold">Gebel Hadarba</span> is a little range of
felsite hills with many peaks rising from the coast-plain close to
Ras Hadarba (Cape Elba of the Admiralty Charts). A triangulation
beacon on one of the highest points is in latitude 22° 2′ 53″,
longitude 36° 47′ 23″, at an altitude of 217 metres above sea.
Gebel Hadarba is drained by a number of small wadis, most of which
empty themselves into the quicksands of Kuatianai which cover the
projection of Cape Elba. A high hill at the south-west end of the
Hadarba range bears the special name of <span class=
"bold">Wiekorei</span>, while a tract of low red hills on the Sudan
frontier a few kilometres south of the Hadarba range, is called
<span class="bold">Timaiakwaia</span>; this latter tract is chiefly
drained by the Wadi Qabatit.</p>

"#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a></p>

<hr class="decor spaced2 width4">

<p class="space-above2">The sources of water in South-Eastern
Egypt, as in the Egyptian deserts generally, may be divided into
three main classes:—</p>

<p><a class="link2" href="#c07s1">(1)</a> Springs;</p>

<p><a class="link2" href="#c07s2">(2)</a> Wells;</p>

<p><a class="link2" href="#c07s3">(3)</a> Rock basins.</p>

<h3><a id="c07s1"></a>Springs.</h3>

<p>As springs are classified those water sources where water issues
naturally from the rocks, either above or near ground level,
without the aid of artificial excavation. As will be seen on
looking through the list of water sources on <a href="#Page_244"
class="pginternal">pp. 244</a> to 250, springs are less common than
wells and rock basins, but some of the best known water sources,
such as those of Abraq, Abu Saafa, Abu Hodeid, and Meneiga, belong
to this class. The Arabic word for spring is <em>Ain</em>, but the
Bedouin seldom use this word, calling springs and wells alike
<em>Bir</em>, which properly signifies a well. Small springs are
called <em>Megal</em> by the Ababda, and <em>Megwel</em> by the
Bisharin tribes.</p>

<p>Springs may occur in any kind of rock, but the rock must be
either of a porous nature or must contain fissures. Thus the
springs of Abu Saafa and Abraq occur in sandstone, which is itself
porous and permits the passage of water through the body of the
rock, while the springs of Meneiga occur in a crushed serpentine,
which, though not itself a porous rock, is full of fissures and
crush-planes, and thus is capable of holding and giving passage to
underground waters. It is in consequence of the non-porosity and
the comparative fewness of fissures in granitic rocks that springs
are seldom seen to issue from rocks of this class.</p>

<p>The collecting areas of the Eastern Desert springs are mostly in
the immediate neighbourhood of the springs themselves. Thus, for
instance, the springs of Abu Saafa and Abraq are fed by the
rainfall on the great sandstone plateaux which surround them, while
those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span> of Meneiga
are supplied by the rainfall on the mountain mass of Gebel Gerf. In
consequence of the fact that the waters do not travel very far
underground before they issue from the springs, the water is
generally cool. The yield of the springs is usually small, rarely
exceeding ten litres a minute from any individual spring, but it is
wonderfully constant; the rocks of the collecting area form a huge
reservoir which only parts slowly with its water contents, and thus
springs may go on yielding supplies when, after a succession of
three or four nearly rainless years, many of the wells and rock
basins are quite dry.</p>

<p>As a rule, spring waters are very clear and potable. The purest
are those which pass through siliceous rocks such as sandstone;
where the rocks are rich in lime and magnesia, as serpentines and
gabbros, the salt-content of the spring may be fairly considerable,
but there is no known spring in this part of Egypt of which the
water is so salt as to be disagreable to the taste.<a id=
"FNanchor_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114" class=
"fnanchor">[114]</a> It is their constancy combined with the purity
of their water that makes the springs the most highly prized of
desert water sources.</p>

<p>Springs are mostly on or near the main camel roads, for the
roads are naturally selected so as to utilise these constant water
supplies. Frequently, however, the spring is situated up a lateral
valley some little distance from the main track, and is more or
less difficult of access. The springs of Abu Saafa are on a main
road, where the Wadi Hodein cuts cleanly through the sandstone
plateau; but those of Meneiga, being at the head of a
<em>cul-de-sac</em>, are only approachable by a branch track. At
large springs the Arabs generally dig out a series of basins into
which the water flows, so that these are always full of water ready
for the camels of a caravan to drink. At <em>megals</em> there is
usually no pool, or only a very small one, in sand or detritus;
this sand is scooped out and the water is baled from the hole with
a tin can. The absence of a pool is probably due to a desire to
check evaporation. The flow at a <em>megal</em> is frequently so
small that only a few litres per hour can be obtained; the small
trickling spring of Sikait, for instance, was yielding only twenty
gallons of water <em>per diem</em> in 1906, but even this small
supply was highly prized by the miners working there, on account of
its purity as a drinking water.</p>

<p><em>Megals</em> are more likely to run dry than the larger
springs, owing to their smaller collecting area. Any attempt to
increase the flow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
of springs by blasting or excavation would probably only give an
increase in yield at the expense of constancy; the throttling of
the efflux is doubtless in many cases the chief reason for the
perennial character of the yield of a spring, the rainfall being
insufficient to maintain greater supplies than the springs yield at
present.</p>

<h3><a id="c07s2"></a>Wells.</h3>

<p>The wells of South-Eastern Egypt are mostly shallow excavations
in the alluvia of the wadi floors, tapping the drainage waters
which slowly percolate underground Nilewards and seawards from the
mountain ranges. They are naturally more frequent in the districts
near to the mountain ranges than in the lower reaches of the wadis,
and the best wells are usually in well-defined trunk wadis which
collect the drainage from myriads of smaller valleys. The wells
sunk in the wadis at points remote from the mountain ranges are of
immense importance to travellers crossing from the Nile, forming as
they do the only supplies in an otherwise waterless journey of
several days.</p>

<p>On an average, water is reached at a depth of eight to ten
metres; occasionally, where the wadi is crossed underground by a
rocky bar, the natural damming enables water to be reached at very
shallow depths. The shafts dug by the Arabs are generally wide and
very crooked, in order to permit of a man descending to fill a
water-skin. Usually a “well” consists of three or four such shafts
sunk in proximity. Occasionally, especially in the Bisharin
country, the shafts are lined with rubble masonry, and rough
timbers may be stretched across the mouth to facilitate hoisting by
ropes. There is never any hoisting gear except at mines; rope is
too much prized by the Arabs for it to be possible to leave ropes
unguarded at a well, so each caravan uses its own rope and skins.
Occasionally, the shaft is so cranked that the water cannot be seen
from above. The reason for this is chiefly laziness in excavation;
it is easier to deepen a well by driving out laterally a short
distance and then sinking a narrow pit, throwing out the excavated
material into the larger main shaft, than to hoist all to the
surface. Near the wells one usually finds <em>hods</em>, or mud
basins, into which the Arabs pour the hoisted water for their
animals to drink. Frequently there are high <em>hods</em> for
camels and low ones for sheep and goats.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>After every
considerable rainfall the wells become filled up with stony
downwash, and have to be dug out afresh. There is no protective
wall to prevent infilling; and, contrary to what might at first be
thought, it is not laziness which conditions this circumstance. To
the Arab, wells are a last resource. After rain, all the
<em>galts</em> (rock basins) are full of good water. The Arab knows
that the supplies in these <em>galts</em> will evaporate, while
those in the wells, covered in by alluvium, are safe from loss by
this cause. He therefore draws his supplies from <em>galts</em> as
long as he can, and only when these are empty does he open the
wells. The main wells never fail except after unusually prolonged
drought, and then the condition of the Arab is sore indeed. The
Bisharin do not drink much water, preferring to nourish themselves
on the milk of their flocks and herds; but in times of drought the
milk supply falls off because there is not sufficient moist
vegetation for the animals to feed on.</p>

<p>The quality of water from the wells varies enormously with their
situation and at different times. When water is abundant, it is
generally good; but as the supply falls off and the wells have to
be deepened, the slow infiltration carries abundance of sodium,
calcium, and magnesium salts from the rocks, and the water is then
often very unpleasant. The following analyses by Mr. Lucas of
water-samples from some of the wells in 1906 will give a good
general idea of the salts present; the figures give milligrammes
per litre (parts per million):—</p>

<p class="nind">Dr. Natterer records that the sample, which was
clear, tasted slightly alkaline, and contained very distinct traces
of nitrites and nitrates, free carbon dioxide, free ammonia, and
organic matter. During my stay of four days at Halaib in May 1908,
I drank regularly of the local well-water; I found it very hard,
and though the Arabs seemed to like it, its action on myself was so
strongly aperient that I sent into the mountains to Bir Frukit for
purer supplies for use on the long march to Port Sudan.</p>

<p>As a rule, it is the magnesium salts which are the most harmful
constituents, the sulphate giving a strong purgative character to
the water. Such salts are naturally present in greatest quantity
where the rocks are gypseous, as for instance along the coast to
the south of Halaib, where the wells of Ti Kureitra, sunk in gypsum
and lined with blocks of selenite, yield water of so purgative a
character that all my Arabs who drank of it became violently ill.
In districts where the rocks are of very basic igneous types, such
as gabbros and serpentines, the salt-content may also be fairly
high. Water from diorite country is somewhat better, that from
granite better still, and that from sandstone best of all. There
are practically no wells in clayey strata within the region here
treated of, but Bir Qoleib, which is on the road from Daraw at
about two days’ journey east of the Nile, is sunk at the foot of a
clayey scarp, and the water, when I partook of it in 1907, was
clouded with clayey matter so finely divided as to be unfilterable
through a Berkefeld filter even under strong pressure, while the
physiological action of the water was to produce very marked
constipation. Wells near the sea coast are liable to be very salty
from infiltration of sea water. As a rule, the very salt wells,
such as Bir Murra, Bir Muelih, Bir Shalatein, and Ti
Kureitra,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span> are used
only by camels and sheep. When the Arabs have to drink purgative
water for lack of other supplies, they often mix milk with it, and
I have found it wise to imitate them in this respect, with liberal
addition of brandy in some cases.</p>

<p>Wells are generally named after the wadi in which they occur,
<em>e.g.</em>, Bir Abu Hashim is the well in Wadi Abu Hashim. A
bitter well is often called Bir Murra.<a id=
"FNanchor_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118" class=
"fnanchor">[118]</a> A deep well is called <em>Sararat</em> by the
Bisharin, <em>e.g.</em>, Bir Sararat Seyet is the deep well in Wadi
Seyet.</p>

<p>Questions are often asked as to whether it is not possible to
increase the available water supplies by sinking fresh wells. Where
it is a question of sinking a new well in the middle of a long
waterless stretch, or where the object is to sink a fresh well near
an existing salty one in order to obtain a drinkable quality of
water (and these are the two most usual cases), success cannot be
predicted with any certainty, even in the most likely looking
spots. We must remember that though the present Arabs may be lazy,
the older tenants of the desert were more active. We have only to
look at the old mining centres to see this. The probability is that
the old miners were just as much worried by the scarcity of water
as we are to-day, and with the cheap convict labour then available
we may rest assured that every attempt was made to increase the
supply. And it is not probable that the Arabs will have allowed to
fall into disuse any existing well on an otherwise waterless road,
so that it is likely that most of the wells in the wadis remote
from the mountains are at spots specially favourable which have
been discovered by a laborious process of trial and error.
Confirmation of this view is supplied by the failure of new wells
sunk at considerable cost in likely-looking places, as for instance
at Abu Rahal, where a well carried down to over sixty metres’ depth
failed to find water. Where modern wells have obtained water, they
have usually been sunk near to or on the site of existing wells, as
for instance near the temple of Seti I and at the different mining
centres; in these cases it has sometimes been found possible to
increase the supply by going deeper. And with regard to obtaining
sweet water by sinking new wells near to old salty ones, no success
can be hoped for if the saltiness is due to a general salt-content
in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span> surrounding
rocks; the Mines Department well in Wadi Mellaha<a id=
"FNanchor_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119" class=
"fnanchor">[119]</a> yielded no better water than the Arab well in
the same wadi, because the alluvium everywhere in the wadi contains
abundance of salt. In some cases, it may be, the promotion of a
more rapid flow would lead to a slight lessening in the salinity;
but if a well becomes salt merely by evaporation resulting from
stagnation, that very fact shows that it is not much used by the
ordinary traveller; and moreover the rate of flow of the
underground water is not as a rule sufficiently rapid to yield
large supplies, even from wide excavations.</p>

<p>In the south parts of the country, where the rainfall is
greater, it is possible, nay, even likely, that many new wells
could be sunk with success; but in these localities existing wells
are more abundant and the necessity for new wells does not
arise.</p>

<h3><a id="c07s3"></a>Rock Basins (Galts).</h3>

<p>The typical rock basin, called a <em>galt</em><a id=
"FNanchor_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120" class=
"fnanchor">[120]</a> by the Arabs, is a smooth-sided cavity in the
rocky floor of a steep gorge draining a large mass of high hills.
Galts are generally difficult of access, being situated in the
higher parts of very stony wadis, so that one has to tramp often
over miles of steeply rising stony ground to reach them. Galts
abound in all high mountain-masses in South-Eastern Egypt, and
furnish the greater portion of the water supply of the population.
The capacity of galts varies very much; some hold millions of
litres. Often there is a chain of successive galts at intervals
along the length of a gorge, and after rain the whole series is
filled, while much overflows and runs to waste. The origin of the
rocky basins is generally due to pot-holing action on a large
scale. Galts may occur in rocks of any hard type, but are most
commonly met with in eruptive rocks. Sandstone galts never remain
long full, owing to the permeable nature of the rocks. The large
Galt el Aguz near Gebel Um Harba, which from the inscriptions near
it was evidently known and used in Ptolemaic times, is in
sandstone, receiving in fact the superficial run-off from the same
high mass of sandstone hills as furnish the collecting<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span> area for feeding by
percolation and underground flow the adjacent springs of Bir Abraq
and Abu Saafa; but the galt is seldom full for more than a month or
two, while the springs are constant.</p>

<p>The water supply of galts depends firstly on the rainfall of the
district; secondly, on the existing drainage system; thirdly, on
the presence and size of eroded basins along the lines of drainage;
fourthly, on the nature of the rocks forming the basin, and,
lastly, on the degree of exposure to evaporation. The rainfall in
the Eastern Desert is often very local. A series of galts full one
year may be dry the next, while those of another area may show a
reverse state of things. The drainage system most favourable to
galts is one formed by the union of long narrow steep-sided gullies
into a single gorge. The presence of basins is conditioned by the
steepness of the drainage and the hardness of the rocky floor; if
the rocks are soft or much crushed, galts are very unlikely to
occur. Again, if the basin is formed of permeable though hard rock,
there will be rapid loss by infiltration. Evaporation is generally
far less rapid at galts than in open country, because being in
narrow gorges galts only receive the sun’s rays for a few hours of
the day, and are, moreover, sheltered from winds.</p>

<p>The quality of galt water varies very much with the interval
since rainfall and with the nature of the rocks. Sandstone galts
are very pure, because of their short life and the siliceous nature
of the rock. Serpentine and diorite galts contain magnesium and
other salts, and as the loss by evaporation continues the water may
become somewhat bitter and purgative by concentration of these
saline constituents, though galts never suffer to the extent that
some wells do in this respect.</p>

<p>A galt is frequently accompanied by a small spring
(<em>megal</em> or <em>megwel</em>); the galt represents the
run-off, while the spring receives the percolating water. Thus for
months after a galt is empty it may in some cases be possible to
obtain water in small quantity by scooping out sand-filled rock
cavities close to the basin.</p>

<p>Galts are generally named after the mountain in which they
occur, though when large and well known they may have special names
given to them, as in the case of the Galt el Aguz mentioned
above.</p>

<h3><span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>Remarks on
Water Transport.</h3>

<p>As will be gathered from the map on <a href="#pl03">Plate
III,</a> water supplies are seldom more than two days’ march apart
in this part of Egypt. For the ordinary traveller it will therefore
be usually an ample provision to carry four days’ supply; in
special cases, where it is desired to camp for any purpose remote
from water sources, special provision will of course have to be
made. There is seldom any trouble with the Arabs about their own
water, as when their supplies run short one or two camels can
always be detached from a caravan to fill their skins from the
nearest well, and they are always content to travel day and night
for this purpose. With regard to the quantity of water to be
carried, I found ten gallons per European per day to be ample,
including water for cooking and for one’s personal servants. Water
is best carried in rectangular galvanized iron tanks, each holding
ten gallons, fitted with a good brass or wooden plug; two of these
carried horizontally make a light camel load, and on the march one
can add a little in the shape of tents or bedding to the load. I
have tried the barrel-shaped galvanised steel tanks used by the
mining companies, which hold sixteen gallons each and are easily
carried vertically, a pair forming a camel load; but I have found
them much more liable to damage than the smaller rectangular tanks,
and do not recommend them for regular desert travel.</p>

<h3>List of Water Sources.</h3>

<p>In the following list I have summarized all the water sources
known to me in order of latitude from north to south. I believe the
list contains all sources that are of importance, but it is
doubtless far from being complete as regards the rock basins of the
mountain areas for two reasons. Firstly, the Arabs are often
reluctant to point out the sources, more especially in the more
arid parts of the Ababda country; and secondly, as already
remarked, since the rock basins depend for their supplies entirely
on comparatively recent rainfall around them, they vary very much
in yield in different years, so that basins which are of great use
in one year may be totally dry the next, and <em>vice-versa</em>,
and guides seldom take the trouble to point out a dry<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span> basin, even if in some other
year it may have held a useful store of water.</p>

<p>With regard to the accuracy of the positions given in the list,
it may be remarked that in the case of wells actually visited the
position is given to seconds, and the localisation may be relied on
within at most a few hundred metres; while for wells not actually
seen but whose positions were pointed out by guides from some
distance, the coordinates are usually only given to minutes, and
these positions are uncertain by larger amounts, up to two or three
kilometres in extreme cases.</p>

<p>It must not be assumed that water supplies can <em>always</em>
be obtained at all the localities named. As already remarked, rock
basins will usually only be full if rain has fallen in the district
comparatively recently, large rock basins may furnish supplies for
a year after rainfall, but the smaller ones last only a few months,
weeks, or even days. The reserves are the wells, most of which
never run dry except after a succession of rainless years. But when
rock basins are full, many of the wells are filled with downwash,
and digging must be resorted to in order to re-open them. A
traveller arriving at a “well” sometimes finds no evidence whatever
of its existence beyond the guides pointing to a spot on the ground
with the statement “<em>el bir hena</em>” (the well is here). The
explanation is that the well has been filled with alluvial matter
washed down the valley by recent rain; but that same rainfall will
have filled the rock basins in the hills, and the Arabs leave the
digging out of the well until the basins are empty again. In other
cases a well may be found to be dry through the water-level having
sunk below the depth to which the well was last opened, and by
deepening it a foot or so one may obtain a supply.</p>

<p>The notes in the column headed “Remarks,” on the quality of the
water of the various sources, are mostly based on the observations
of a single year, and must therefore only be taken as general
guides. Usually, the shorter the interval since rain has fallen,
the better are the supplies, both in quantity and quality.</p>

<p class="sch">GEOLOGY.—SEDIMENTARY ROCKS.</p>

<hr class="decor spaced2 width4">

<p class="space-above2">Only a small proportion of South-Eastern
Egypt is covered by sedimentary rocks. As will be seen from a
glance at the geological map on <a href="#pl20">Plate XX,</a>
sedimentary strata are to be found only in the north-western and
central portions of the area, where the Nubian sandstone which
covers so much of the country close east of the Nile terminates in
a long south-easterly projection, and along certain portions of the
coast, where small outliers of Nubian sandstone and patches and
strips of gypseous limestones and coral reef occur. The oldest
rocks of undoubted sedimentary origin, the Nubian sandstones, are
of Cretaceous age. Tertiary beds are absent, except for the
gypseous strata of Ras Benas, which may possibly be Miocene.
Quaternary deposits are represented by Pleistocene and Recent coral
reefs and beach deposits, and by accumulations of alluvial
downwash, blown sand, and calcareous tufa.</p>

<p>The sedimentary deposits may thus be classified into:—</p>

<p>(1) <em>Recent Deposits</em> (<a class="link2" href=
"#c08s1">coral reefs and raised beaches</a>, <a class="link2" href=
"#c08s2">blown sand</a>, <a class="link2" href="#c08s3">alluvial
deposits</a>, and <a class="link2" href="#c08s4">calcareous
tufa</a>).</p>

<p>(2) <a class="link2" href="#c08s5"><em>Gypsum and Gypseous
Limestones</em></a> (of uncertain age, possibly Miocene).</p>

<p>(3) <a class="link2" href="#c08s6"><em>Nubian Sandstone</em></a>
(Cretaceous).</p>

<h3><a id="c08s1"></a>Coral Reefs and Raised Beaches.</h3>

<p>Coral reefs fringe almost the entire coast-line of South-Eastern
Egypt, rendering the coast one of the foulest in the world for
shipping. Coral forms the islands of Wadi Gemal, Gulhan, Mukawar,
Mirear, Seyal, and Halaib, these rising to a few metres above the
sea; but in general it is not met with on the main land except
close to the shore. The reefs may extend, slightly raised, some
distance inland, but cannot be seen owing to the sand and downwash
from the mountains<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
which covers the sloping coast-plain. At low water great expanses
of nearly level coral reef, stretching out for a kilometre or more
from the shore, are exposed in places, especially near Ras Benas.
Frequently a line of reefs can be seen running for many miles
parallel to the coast at a distance of a kilometre or more from it;
these outer reefs can be traced in windy weather by the breaking of
waves on them, and in calm weather by the lighter colour of the
water over them. There is frequently deep water between the outer
reefs and the shore. Openings in the outer reefs, through which
boats can pass into the sheltered water within, are called
<em>mersas</em> by the Arab boatmen; they frequently occur opposite
the mouths of the larger wadis. Coral reef forms a tough, hard, and
very porous limestone, with an extremely rough surface on which the
structure of the astraean and other corals composing it can be
clearly seen. It has been used for building the jetty at Halaib,
and rough blocks of it were anciently employed for building at
Berenice, as well as in the tombs at Suakin el Qadim; but its
porosity and intractability would never recommend it as a building
stone if any other could be found locally.</p>

<p>In close association with coral reefs are beach deposits of
Pleistocene age. These occur round the hills near the tip and on
the north side of the peninsula of Ras Benas, where they cover the
slopes of the gypseous limestone hills. Low hills and banks of very
white aspect occur near the sea further north; these are probably
also raised beaches, though they have not been visited and may
possibly be gypsum. Near the tip of Ras Benas these beach deposits
are gritty limestones with abundant casts of lamellibranchs and
gasteropods, mostly in bad preservation, as well as various
echinoids, among which M. Fourtau has identified the species
<i>Brissus carinatus</i> as one of the most abundant.</p>

<h3><a id="c08s2"></a>Blown Sand.</h3>

<p>The dune-forming sand in South-Eastern Egypt is exactly similar
to that which covers such large areas in the Libyan Desert. It
consists of well-rounded quartz grains, averaging about a
millimetre in diameter; the grains are usually of a golden-yellow
colour, owing to their being coated with a thin superficial film of
iron oxide.</p>

<p>The only area where sand dunes are of any considerable magnitude
or extent in South-Eastern Egypt is the tract called I Hubâl (lit.
“the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span> sand dunes”)
which extends from Wadi Meisah to Wadi Aideib, fronting the hills
of Ti Keferiai, Geror, Balatitda, Sul Hamid, and El Sela. The north
faces of all these hills and the smaller hills north of them are
swathed in thickly accumulated sand to such an extent as to make
travelling over them difficult. The reason for the heavy sand
accumulation at this particular place is that the north-west wind,
which is the prevalent wind over Egypt proper, here meets with
south-easterly winds coming up the Red Sea, causing a local calm
and a consequent dropping of the sand borne from the Nubian
sandstone areas by the north-west wind. Thus the same climatic
conditions which give rise to the rich vegetation on the Elba
mountains cause at the same time extreme desert conditions in the
tract immediately north-west of them.</p>

<p>Sand accumulations of less magnitude occur in and about the
lower reaches of the Wadi Hodein, in the great valley to the north
of Berenice, on the plain west of Gebel Um Harba, and at some few
other places, but they are seldom so extensive as to cause a
serious hindrance to travel.</p>

<p>Besides transporting the ordinary dune-forming sand, the action
of the wind is responsible for a considerable amount of
redistribution of the coarser granitic and other sand produced by
the disintegration of igneous rocks. In high winds this coarse
sand, in angular grains as large as peas, is blown about on the
coast-plain to considerable distances from the places where it was
originally deposited by water transport.</p>

<h3><a id="c08s3"></a>Alluvial Deposits.</h3>

<p>The degradation of the mountain and hill masses which is
constantly going on under sub-aerial agencies (disintegration by
variations of temperature, and transport by water during occasional
rain storms) has in the course of centuries resulted in immense
accumulations of alluvial material (sand and gravel) along all the
drainage lines and on the plains. Disintegration is in many places
greatly facilitated by the crushed nature of the rocks, due to the
tectonic movements which they have suffered during the process of
folding and mountain formation. This fact is specially evident in
the case of the more basic rocks. Serpentines, for instance, are
frequently so crushed and cracked that<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_254">[254]</span> one may search in vain over a whole
mountain for a place where the rock is sufficiently free from
cracks to allow of a hand-specimen of the ordinary size being
extracted without breaking up into fragments under the hammer. In
the more acid rocks, like the granites, crushing has been a less
powerful aid to disintegration, and here the diurnal
temperature-range has been the principal factor; the rock, being an
aggregate of crystals of different materials with different
coefficients of expansion, has been easily broken up at its surface
by the constant differential motion of its component grains,
resulting in the formation of coarse granitic sand. Chemical action
in denudation is of quite subordinate importance. Though some
chemical action has taken place, as for instance in the
kaolinisation of the felspars, we find as a rule that the alluvial
accumulations consist principally of unaltered rock fragments.</p>

<p>In material, the alluvial accumulations are of the same varied
nature as the mountains from whose degradation they have
originated, ranging from very basic mineral substances, such as
serpentine, to the most acid, such as quartz. The relative
proportions of the different materials in the alluvial deposits do
not, however, correspond as a rule with the proportions in which
they enter into the mountain masses. Not only are heterogeneous
rocks, such as granites and diorites, far more rapidly
disintegrated by temperature-changes than are the more homogeneous
rocks such as felsites and serpentines, but the fragments produced
by the disintegration of granitic rocks are rounder and of much
smaller size than the fragments resulting from the breaking up of
felsites, schists, and serpentines. The result is that granitic
detritus is transported to greater distances and distributed over
larger areas than the detritus of the closer-grained and more
homogeneous rocks. In approaching a mountain composed of about
equal parts of, say, granite and serpentine, we accordingly find
the lower portions of the wadi consist chiefly of granitic sand,
while the coarser and more angular detritus of serpentine is only
seen in abundance in the higher parts of the drainage channel. The
nature of the alluvium of the wadi floor occasionally gives its
name to the wadi; thus, of the two wadis which by their junction
form Wadi Khoda, one is called Wadi Salib el Azrak, because its
alluvium consists of dark rock fragments, while the other is called
Wadi Salib el Abiad, because its floor is formed of white granitic
sand. (<em>Azrak</em> = dark; <em>Abiad</em> = white).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>In size, the
fragments composing alluvial detritus vary from huge blocks
weighing tons down to the finest sand whose grains are only a
fraction of a millimetre in diameter. As a rule, of course, the
larger fragments are found near the heads of wadis, and the finer
sands in their lower reaches and on the plains. But often we find
great boulders mixed with the sand at immense distances from the
parent mountain mass; the heavier rain storms which occasionally
break over the mountains produce for short periods such immense
rushes of water down the wadis, that great boulders are swept along
and incorporated in the finer material which is deposited in times
of more normal rainfall. Thus it is no uncommon thing in sinking a
well in a wadi fifty kilometres or more from the mountains to
encounter great boulders in the sandy alluvium.</p>

<p>In shape, the alluvial fragments vary very much, according to
their mineral nature and the amount of rolling they have received
in transport. Foliated rocks, like schists and slates, produce
typically flaky fragments which seldom attain any high degree of
rounding; the same is true of serpentines which have been shattered
by crushing. Granitic rocks produce generally more symmetrical
fragments, though granitic sand is typically angular unless it has
been transported for considerable distances. The larger blocks are
generally rounded in the case of granitic rocks, even when they
have not travelled for any great distance; for if a cubical block
of granite be exposed to weathering, disintegration takes place
most rapidly at the corners, and the block eventually becomes more
or less spheroidal without having moved at all. This can be well
seen in such masses as Gebel Selaia, where the granite boss is
thoroughly well rounded <em>in situ</em>. The same phenomenon can
be noticed in certain dolerites, where portions of the rock
detached by joint planes have weathered <em>in situ</em> into forms
like cannon balls. The more homogeneous rocks like felsite and
serpentine, as well as the foliated rocks like gneisses, schists,
and slates, do not show much of this rounding <em>in situ</em>, as
they yield to the stresses of expansion and contraction by breaking
along planes of crushing or foliation, producing separate masses
which preserve most of their angular shape. In the lower reaches of
the wadis and on the plains, of course, all the materials are more
or less rounded, owing to the attrition to which they have been
subjected during transport.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>Of the thickness
of the alluvial sands and gravels very little is known. But that it
exceeds eight metres in many of the wadis is proved by wells sunk
to that depth. On the coast-plain it may be vastly thicker, for
Grabham<a id="FNanchor_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122" class=
"fnanchor">[122]</a> mentions that borings made in the maritime
plain near Port Sudan have been carried down to 1,000 feet (305
metres) in the deposits. Only a very small proportion of the
alluvial detritus brought down the wadis enters either the sea or
the Nile; for the storm-formed streams, though violent in the
mountainous tracts, commonly cease by being absorbed in the thirsty
wadi floors and plains before reaching either the sea or the river.
Bearing this in mind, and the ages through which the actions of
denudation and transport have gone on, we can well imagine how
great must be the total quantity of detritus accumulated.</p>

<p>In some wadis there are high banks of old detritus through which
the streams have cut their way. In the Wadi Meneiga, for instance,
there are terraces of alluvium, some eight or ten metres high, on
either side of the present water channel; these terraces, which are
about two kilometres lower down the wadi than the wells, are
covered with rude rubble ruins, the remains of dwellings erected
out of reach of the occasional streams which rush down the wadi
after rain.</p>

<p>At the east foot of Gebel Hamra Dom are some well stratified
friable sand rocks and sandy clays, about ten metres thick, ending
abruptly against the granites and schists of the hill-mass. These
beds appear to be ancient alluvial deposits. They contain
ferruginous scales and show sun-cracks in places, while the
materials are finer and more distinctly stratified than one would
expect to be brought down from the mountain under present
conditions.</p>

<p>It is to the alluvial material in the wadis that the Eastern
Desert owes most of its perennial water supplies and the vegetation
it possesses. The alluvial deposits are the great conservers of
water. Pools form, it is true, in the bare rocky beds of the higher
drainage lines, and may last for many months where they are
screened by the walls of a gorge from wind and sun, and are in
consequence not subject to rapid evaporation. But such pools are
difficult of access, and afford but a precarious source of water
supply because they are liable to dry up if a long period passes
without rain. The alluvium of the wadis<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_257">[257]</span> absorbs the rainfall and protects it from
evaporation, so that even in very dry years water may be found by
excavating in it at suitable places to depths of a few metres.
Almost all the wells which are so important to travellers crossing
the desert from the Nile are of this character. The abundance of
trees which flourish in so many of the wadis likewise derive their
nourishment from the water conserved in the alluvium of the wadi
floor.</p>

<h3><a id="c08s4"></a>Calcareous Tufa.</h3>

<p>Small deposits of calcareous tufa of recent origin have been
noted in the Wadi Um Tundeba and in a gorge on the east side of
Gebel Ghuel, as well as round the little trickling spring called
Megwel Hamida in the south part of the region.</p>

<p>At Um Tundeba the deposit occurs in a little gully close to a
well known <em>galt</em> or pool of rain water. The deposit is not
extensive, and has doubtless been formed by the evaporation of
trickling drainage-water which had absorbed lime from the rocks.
The tufa (10,374) is a pale brown rock of rather porous nature; it
envelops fragments of schist-debris from the surrounding rocks.</p>

<p>The calcareous tufa of Gebel Ghuel is a more impressive deposit,
though its total mass is not very great. It occurs at a point of
sudden fall in a narrow rocky gorge leading to the Wadi Ghadir in
about latitude 22° 53′. Proceeding up the gully one is confronted
with a great curtain-like mass of tufa covering the face of a high
ledge like a solidified cascade. Here also the origin is clearly
due to trickling of lime-laden drainage-waters over the ledge of
rock, which forms a step in the wadi floor.</p>

<p>Fragments of tufa were also seen round about Gebel Allawi,
though the rock was not traced to its source. As only a relatively
small number of rocky gullies have been explored, it is likely that
similar deposits to those above described occur in many other
places.</p>

<h3><a id="c08s5"></a>Gypsum and Gypseous Limestones.</h3>

<p>The occurrences of gypsum and gypseous limestone beds in
South-Eastern Egypt are restricted to the coastal regions. The most
prominent of the deposits are those on Ras Benas (<em>see</em> map
on <a href="#pl21">Plate XXI</a>),<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_258">[258]</span> where the beds form white hills rising to
188 metres above sea-level. Further north, gypseous deposits have
been found by Dr. Hume to exist near the sea at Bir el Ranga, and
by Mr. Ferrar the same beds have been recorded as occurring near
the coast in the neighbourhood of Wadi Igli. It appears probable
that the gypseous strata form a continuous or nearly continuous
strip extending along the coast down to latitude 24° 22′, as shown
on the geological map on <a href="#pl20">Plate XX,</a> but more
complete observations may show that the distribution of the beds is
somewhat different from that indicated. On the coast-plain south of
Ras Benas, gypseous beds are not exposed except in the extreme
south-east corner of Egypt, where they form small patches at Halaib
and round the wells of Ti Kureitra.</p>

<p>At Ras Benas, where the beds have been studied in most detail,
they consist of gypsum and anhydrite [11,513]<a id=
"FNanchor_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123" class=
"fnanchor">[123]</a> alternating with sandy marls and marly sands,
forming hills much cut-up by steep sided narrow ravines. The
weathered faces of the rocks are very soft, and the disintegrated
material forms a stretch of soft gypseous sand, into which one’s
feet sink four or five centimetres at every step, between the hills
and the shore. At Halaib, gypseous limestones crop out from under
the gravel of the coast-plain and form low banks; the gypsum is
here associated with calcareous grits [12,152, 12,114] and
conglomerates, the latter having boulders of igneous rock set in a
calcareous matrix. Near Ti Kureitra wells, the gypsum exposures
contain much crystalline selenite, blocks of this material being
used in the masonry lining of the wells. Both at Bir el Ranga and
on Ras Benas the gypsum is found to contain small pockets of native
sulphur.</p>

<p>No fossils have been found in the gypseous strata, and their
geological age is uncertain. The beds are younger than the Nubian
sandstone, since they overlie that formation at Bir el Ranga. Their
occurrence only near the coast leads one to regard them as having
been formed after the Red Sea occupied its present position; but
whether they originated as direct gypseous deposits, or were
produced by the alteration of pre-existent Cretaceous or Tertiary
limestones is not yet quite certain. It is noteworthy that at Ras
Benas, where the gypseous strata rest on diorite and hornblende
granite, the igneous rocks are considerably altered as if by
weathering, with a strong brick-red colour due to the oxidation of
ferruginous matter.</p>

<h3><span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span><a id=
"c08s6"></a>The Nubian Sandstone.</h3>

<p>The Nubian sandstone covers a comparatively small portion of
South-Eastern Egypt, occupying only about one-tenth of the total
area under consideration. The greater portion of it forms the
eastern termination of the vast sandstone plateaux which stretch
eastward from the Nile towards the igneous and metamorphic
back-bone of the Red Sea mountains, but there are in addition some
small patches on the eastern side of the watershed which are
interesting as showing that the deposition of the sandstone was not
confined to the western side of the mountain ranges.</p>

<p>The most northerly exposure of Nubian sandstone in the district
here described extends with some breaks southward from near Gebel
Sufra to near Gebel Homr Akarim, forming low hills. Further south,
it comes in again on both sides of the Wadi Garara, forming the
hills of Felieiti and Abu Hashim. In the sandy plain around the
Wadi Timsah are outlying sandstone hills of considerable height and
extent, the principal being Gebels Nuggur, Mulgata, and Ziraga.
Further south-west, the Nubian sandstone forms an extensive high
broken plateau stretching southward from near Gebel Zergat Naam to
near Gebel Um Reit, sending out a long tongue south-eastwards
across Wadi Dif to near Gebel Nigrub el Tahtani. This tract of
broken sandstone plateaux bears various names in different parts,
Gebels Um Harba, Um Khafur, Dagalai, Shebakhit, Awamtib, Um
Sididad, Abraq, Hodein, Dif, Anfeib, and Kala, all forming parts of
the same great sandstone mass, though separated by wadis from each
other. Small outliers of Nubian sandstone cap the hills of Gebels
Reietit, just north of latitude 23°, near the meridian of 34°, and
Gebel Seiga, in latitude 22° 44′, longitude 34° 16′.</p>

<p>On the eastern side of the watershed, Nubian sandstone extends
for some distance near the coast opposite the Gulhan islands, and
also forms small thin outliers south of the Wadi Hodein. The most
southerly point where the sandstone has been met with in the area
is a small outlier in latitude 22° 36′, a few kilometres east of
Gebel Hamra Dom.</p>

<p>In petrographical characters the Nubian sandstone is remarkably
uniform, consisting of medium-sized silica grains set in a more or
less ferruginous cement; the colour varies from nearly white,
through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span> various
shades of brown, to nearly black, according to the amount of iron
present. It is generally well bedded, and frequently much jointed.
There is usually a marked absence of the clay beds which are
associated with the Nubian sandstone in other parts of Egypt. The
basal beds are generally pebbly, forming conglomerates in some
places. Concretions are found in the rock at some points, notably
to the north of Gebel Um Harba. Some of the concretions are hollow,
the shell being of hard dark ferruginous sandstone while the
interior is filled with a powder of snow-white chalky matter
containing sand grains. The only fossils observed in the sandstone
within the area described were collected by Mr. Charteris Stewart
in the plain of Um Harba; they consist of crocodile scales and
various shells. From these and the fossil shells found further west
in sinking a well in Wadi Abu Rahal,<a id=
"FNanchor_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124" class=
"fnanchor">[124]</a> it may be concluded that the Nubian sandstone
here, as in the Nile Valley, is of Cretaceous age.</p>

<p>Intrusions of igneous rock into the sandstone have only been
observed at two points in the area, <em>viz.</em>, near the western
foot of Gebel Awamtib, where a basic dyke runs through the
sandstone, and on the Red Sea coast, near Bir el Ranga, where Dr.
Hume has found andesite interbedded in the sandstone. A bed of
diabase, now much altered, underlies the sandstone near Wadi
Muelih, and is possibly of contemporaneous origin.</p>

<p>In thickness, the Nubian sandstone attains a maximum of about
350 metres in several places round about Bir Abraq and the Wadi
Hodein. Its thickness must at one time have exceeded this, for the
upper surfaces have suffered much denudation, and are not capped by
younger rocks.</p>

<p>Some interest attaches to the maximum altitude reached by the
Nubian sandstone beds. The highest point at which it has
been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span> observed is at
Gebel Seiga, whose sandstone cap is 905 metres above sea-level. The
highest point reached by the rock on the great plateau round about
Wadi Hodein is Gebel Kala, 846 metres above sea.</p>

<p>In contradistinction to the same beds which form the plateau
between longitude 34° and the Nile, the Nubian sandstones within
the area here described show considerable disturbances from their
original horizontal bedding, the dips being as a rule greater and
more variable the nearer one approaches to the watershed
mountain-ranges. These tectonic disturbances, which are important
in connexion with the geological history of the region, will be
considered in <a href="#c11">Chapter XI.</a></p>

was sunk by the Mines Department in 1906, in the hope of obtaining
a water supply. I visited the well in May 1906, when it had
attained a depth of fifty-four metres. The strata passed through
were ten metres alluvium, then thirty-seven metres of sandstones
and clays, followed by a thin band of bituminous shale, and seven
metres of dark grey clays. From near the bottom of the well I
collected specimens of <i>Lingula</i> and a mytiloid shell which
Mr. Bullen Newton compared to <i>Septifer linearis</i>; the latter
shell differs but little from specimens obtained from the English
Gault, and thus tends to show that the Abu Rahal beds are of
Cretaceous age. (<em>See</em> <span class="sc">Hume</span>,

<hr class="decor spaced2 width3">

<p class="sch letter-spaced01">IGNEOUS ROCKS.</p>

<hr class="decor spaced2 width4">

<p class="space-above2">Igneous rocks cover about one-third of the
entire area of South-Eastern Egypt, forming irregularly distributed
tracts, alternating with others occupied by metamorphic rocks,
entering largely into the composition of the principal mountain
masses and also underlying a large portion of the areas covered by
sand on the coast-plain and elsewhere.</p>

<p>Regarded broadly, the igneous rocks of this portion of the
Eastern Desert form two main divisions, namely, an <em>acid</em>
division typified by granite rich in felspar, and a <em>basic</em>
division typified by gabbro. Intermediate types occur, as well as
ultra-acid and ultra-basic rocks, but these are less abundant, and
are generally found in close association with one or other of the
two main types. Rocks of the acid type predominate to the north of
latitude 24°, while further south basic rocks form large portions
of the main mountain tracts, with acid rocks at intervals on either
side down to the Sudan frontier. Most of the igneous rocks are
plutonic. There is a striking paucity of volcanic rocks, a
circumstance doubtless to be ascribed largely to the enormous
denudation which has taken place in the district. The plutonic
masses, with the dykes seaming them, have been elevated and laid
bare, while most of the volcanic outpourings have been denuded away
and others have been altered or devitrified till their original
volcanic nature has become less apparent. Metamorphism has also
affected many of the plutonic masses to such a degree that it is
often difficult to decide whether the rocks should now be placed in
the igneous group, or classed as metamorphic rocks.</p>

<p>For purposes of classification, the igneous rocks of
South-Eastern Egypt may be divided into five main groups, based on
silica-percentage:—</p>

<p>1. <a class="link2" href="#c09s1"><em>Ultra-acid rocks</em>,</a>
containing over 80 per cent of silica.</p>

<p>2. <a class="link2" href="#c09s2"><em>Acid rocks</em>,</a>
containing from 65 to 80 per cent of silica.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>3.
<em>Intermediate rocks</em>:—</p>

<p class="pad2">(<em>a</em>) <a class="link2" href=
"#c09s3a"><em>Sub-acid rocks</em>,</a> with from 60 to 65 per cent
of silica.</p>

<p class="pad2">(<em>b</em>) <a class="link2" href=
"#c09s3b"><em>Sub-basic rocks</em>,</a> with from 55 to 60 per cent
of silica.</p>

<p>4. <a class="link2" href="#c09s4"><em>Basic rocks</em>,</a>
containing from 45 to 55 per cent of silica.</p>

<p>5. <a class="link2" href="#c09s5"><em>Ultra-basic
rocks</em>,</a> with less than 45 per cent of silica.</p>

<p>The classification is based on silica percentage, for although
up to the present it has not been found possible to undertake the
chemical analysis of the rocks, the microscopic examination of thin
sections itself gives a very fair guide to the chemical
composition, and the specific gravities of the different rocks,
which increase progressively from the acid to basic groups, afford
a further guide in this direction. The table on the following page
shows the different rocks comprised within the five main
classes.</p>

<p>The five classes are not all of equal importance. As already
mentioned, the acid and basic types are predominant. The ultra-acid
and sub-acid rocks are present in relatively small quantity, and
are in close relationship with those of the acid series which occur
in great abundance; the rocks of the sub-basic and ultra-basic
groups, on the other hand, though by no means insignificant in
their distribution (diorites and serpentines cover very large
areas), appear to be closely linked in the field with those of the
basic group. The district is so large, and the investigation of it
has been so limited, that it would be unwise to draw from the above
remarks the deduction that the rocks have originated from two main
magmas; the statements are merely those of the facts of
observation, so far as observation has proceeded.</p>

<p>The scheme tabulated above differs from established
classifications only in the inclusion of an <em>ultra-acid</em>
class of rocks. This inclusion is necessitated by the presence in
the district of huge masses of quartz-rocks which are almost
certainly igneous in origin. These rocks are almost pure silica,
and though they are properly regarded as an extreme form of
pegmatite, their silica-percentage (over 95) is too high for them
to be placed with their near relations the granites; and on grounds
of symmetry of classification it appears justifiable to have an
“ultra-acid” class corresponding with that of ultra-basic
rocks.</p>

<h3 class="hvar"><span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_265">[265]</span><a id="c09s1"></a>ULTRA-ACID ROCKS.</h3>

<p><span class="bold">Quartz-rock</span> of igneous origin occurs
in the form of intrusive bosses and veins penetrating older igneous
and metamorphic rocks at Marwot Elemikan and elsewhere. The rock is
practically pure vitreous quartz. Its dazzling white aspect in the
sun renders it very conspicuous in the field. The shape of many of
the masses (bosses), their close association with pegmatite and
aplite in at least one locality, the absence from the veins of
other minerals (calcite and various ores) such as usually accompany
vein-quartz deposited from solution, and the occasional presence in
the rock of mica flakes, all point to an igneous origin, and
justify us in regarding this quartz-rock as the final product of
differentiation of a granitic magma, representing its ultra-acid
portion.</p>

<p>The most conspicuous occurrence of quartz-rock is in the three
nearly conical hills called Marwot<a id="FNanchor_125"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> Elemikan, which rise
from the granitic plain at the head of Wadi Elemikan in latitude
23° 53′, and which from their snow-white colour form landmarks
visible from great distances. The largest and most northerly hill
of the three is a boss about 300 metres in diameter, rising
sixty-eight metres above the plain, which itself has here an
altitude of 580 metres above sea. The other two hills are somewhat
smaller; they lie respectively two kilometres south-east, and two
and half kilometres south, of the largest one; a black hill of
about equal size rises from the plain mid-way between them. The
highest of the three white hills, which was occupied as a
triangulation station, is composed almost entirely of glassy
quartz, the only other mineral seen in it being a white mica, of
which a few flakes were visible in the outer portions. The mass is
cracked in all directions, and the faces of the separated blocks
frequently show a slight yellowish staining.</p>

<p>Another remarkable boss of quartz, similar to that just
described and likewise rising through granite, occurs on the south
side of the Wadi Khoda (latitude 23° 42′) about seven kilometres
above the point where the wadi emerges from the hills on to the
coast-plain. A third occurrence, of much less size, in the floor of
Wadi Abu Marwa, on the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_266">[266]</span> track from Wadi Lahami to Berenice
<em>via</em> the Wadi Naait; the first-mentioned wadi derives its
name from the quartz occurrence in it.</p>

<p>Of igneous quartz veins, the best example is the huge dyke which
forms the back-bone of the ridge called Erf el Fahid, in latitude
25° 0′. Here the vein, which strikes east and west, is in schistose
country. It is at least ten metres wide, rising to a height of
ninety-five metres above the wadi, and can be traced for a length
of nearly two kilometres. Like the rock of Marwot Elemikan, the
quartz of Erf el Fahid shows faint iron-staining in places, but
appears to contain no other minerals. It is weathered to a sintery
appearance in places [10,362],<a id="FNanchor_126"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> and contains some
cavities, from one of which I extracted a handful of loose quartz
crystals [10,363] with pyramids developed at both ends; these last
are evidently deposited from solution, but it is difficult to
assign other than an igneous source for the vein, and the cavities
and loose crystals are probably the product of solution subsequent
to the igneous intrusion.</p>

<p>Going south-west from Erf el Fahid, down the Wadi Muelih, is
another line of ridges, of which the back-bone is a great quartz
vein traceable for some two and a half kilometres along its strike.
Further down the wadi are networks of quartz veins seaming diorite
in all directions on either side of a horse-shoe-shaped hill called
Marwot Rod el Ligaia; this hill is of aplite, and probably
represents a less acid part of the same magma which formed the
quartz veins.<a id="FNanchor_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127"
class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p>

<p>It is significant that there are no traces of mine workings at
any of the places where quartz veins and bosses of the igneous type
occur, notwithstanding the fact that the masses are so conspicuous
as to have surely attracted the eye of every gold-seeking
prospector. Though the loose crystals found at Erf el Fahid show
that there at least aqueous solutions have acted on the rock to a
slight extent, these great igneous quartz masses appear never to
have been impregnated with gold or other ores.</p>

<h3 class="hvar"><span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_267">[267]</span><a id="c09s2"></a>ACID IGNEOUS ROCKS.</h3>

<h4>Granites.</h4>

<p>Granites are the most abundant and most widely distributed of
the igneous rocks of South-Eastern Egypt. They form a large
proportion of the most prominent mountain masses, such as Gebels
Hamrat Wogud, Nugrus, Hamrat Mukbud, Hamata, Faraid, Um Reit,
Mishbih, Adar Qaqa, Adar Aweib, and Elba. They also occur in some
great plain tracts, such as those round Gebel Selaia and to the
west of Gebel Um Reit, where low hills of the rock rise through the
coarse granitic sand which covers most of the plain.</p>

<p>In point of geological age, the granites appear to be the
youngest of the plutonic rocks of the country, forming great
intrusions in the more ancient schists and diorites.</p>

<p>Though sometimes occurring as rounded bosses, as at Gebels
Muelih, Selaia, and Faraid, granite typically forms rather jagged
mountains, more especially in the south parts of the area; the
mountains of Mishbih and Elba, for instance, abound in spiky peaks,
while Qash Amir, the “Scragged Hill” of the Admiralty Chart, is an
extreme example of this mode of weathering. The spikes are often
made up of more or less rounded blocks piled one on another, the
separation and rounding of the blocks being brought about by
jointing and the more rapid weathering of the corners of the
separated masses. Granite mountains, though sometimes white, are
usually of a pink or red colour and are often named accordingly by
the Arabs. In Ababda country, all mountains named <em>Hamrat</em>,
as for instance Hamrat Wogud and Hamrat Mukbud, are composed of red
granite or granitoid gneiss; while in Bisharin country the
corresponding name <em>Adar</em>, as used for example in Adar Qaqa
and Adar Aweib, has the same significance, both the names meaning
<em>red</em>. The beds of wadis draining from granitic mountains,
and plains adjacent to them, are invariably covered with a thick
accumulation of coarse felspathic and quartzose sand derived from
the weathering of the rock. This sand is quite firm to walk on, and
in this respect forms a pleasing contrast to the finer wind-borne
sand derived from the disintegration of sandstone. The granitic
sand being generally white in colour (the redness of the felspars
having largely disappeared in the process of weathering), the wadis
in whose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span> floors it
is largely displayed are frequently named “Wadi el Abiad”
(<em>abiad</em> = white); there are numerous wadis called by this
name, all possessing the common characteristic of draining from
granitic mountains and consequently having a floor of granitic
sand.</p>

<p>Besides the great mountain-forming masses, granites also occur
frequently in the form of dykes or veins, penetrating the gneisses,
schists, and other rocks.</p>

<p>Viewed as a whole, the granites of South-Eastern Egypt are
characterised by their strongly acid composition. Though perfectly
normal granites are found in many places, and a gradual passage
into quartz-syenite may be occasionally traced, yet on the whole
the rocks approximate to the aplitic and pegmatitic types in which
quartz and felspar are associated with very small quantities of
ferro-magnesian minerals.</p>

<p>We may consider the granites as falling mainly into the
following classes:—</p>

<p>1. Normal pink granite.</p>

<p>2. Red pegmatitic granite.</p>

<p>3. Aplite.</p>

<p>4. Biotite-granite.</p>

<p>5. Muscovite-granite.</p>

<p>6. Hornblende-granite.</p>

<p class="main2">NATURAL SIZE.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="bold">Normal pink granite</span> is the form of
granite most commonly met with in South-Eastern Egypt. It forms the
principal rock of many of the mountains, such as Gebels Nugrus,
Selaia, Faraid, Um Reit, Shigigat, Niqrub, Abu Brush, and Hamra
Dom, and also covers large expanses of low hill country, and occurs
as knolls scattered over sandy plains such as that of Selaia and
the tract west of Um Reit. The rock [11,505], a full size
representation of which is shown on <a href="#pl22">Plate XXII,</a>
is composed of pink orthoclase, white oligoclase, quartz, and
biotite, with hornblende, sphene, apatite, and magnetite as
accessory minerals. The pink orthoclase is the dominant
constituent, and gives the colour to the mass; it is sometimes in
grains of about the same size as those of the quartz,
<em>viz.</em>, two to four millimetres in diameter, but frequently
tends to assume a porphyritic habit, the crystals then measuring a
centimetre or more across, and inclining to idiomorphic forms.
Microcline is occasionally sparingly present. The
oligoclase<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span> is
white, and is far less abundant and less conspicuous than the
orthoclase; in the porphyritic varieties of the rock, the
oligoclase is mixed with the quartz and mica of the ground mass. In
some specimens the felspars are fresh, in others [12,133] they show
clouding due to decomposition, with formation of kaolin and
occasionally of sericite. Quartz is present to about half the
amount of the felspars, in grains ranging up to three millimetres
in diameter. The biotite is frequently the only ferro-magnesian
mineral present, occurring in wisps and little nests among the
other minerals; under the microscope it is strongly pleochroic, the
colour varying from usually a pale olive brown to nearly black when
a crystal is rotated over a nicol prism, though in a specimen
[11,531] from the little hill called Sikeit, about five kilometres
west of Berenice, colour range is from pale yellow to deep green.
Hornblende is typically either absent or present only in a very
subordinate amount to the biotite. It is sometimes altered to
chlorite, with separation of granules of iron oxide and formation
of epidote. Sphene, apatite, and magnetite are usually only very
sparingly present, and are only visible on microscopic examination.
In a slide cut from the rock of Gebel Fereyid, however, sphene
forms a crystal measuring 1·6 millimetres across, of the
characteristic wedgelike form (<em>see</em> <a href="#fig04">Fig.
4</a>).</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>The principal variation in mineral composition of the rock is
the greater or less abundance of the biotite, and the occasional
presence of appreciable amounts of hornblende. In a specimen from
Wadi Kreiga [12,133], the biotite is almost absent, its place being
taken by green hornblende, now largely altered to chlorite and
epidote. The ferro-magnesian minerals are as a rule present in
smaller amounts than in average granites, and in some places,
especially near the periphery of the great intrusions, they vanish
almost entirely, and the rock passes gradually into a
pegmatite.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>Variations in
appearance of the rock are also conditioned by the size and habit
assumed by the felspar crystals, by the variations in general
coarseness or fineness of grain, and by the pressures and
weathering influences to which the masses have been subjected.
Where the rock has been crushed, or subjected to unequal pressures
in different directions during consolidation, the porphyritic
crystals tend to lie along definite planes, and the rock may
approximate in appearance to a gneiss. The microscopic sections
from these places show further evidence of crushing in the cracking
of crystals and undulose extinction between crossed nicols. Where
the rock is much weathered it usually takes on a whiter aspect due
to the bleaching of the orthoclase, and sometimes exhibits green
spots due to the formation of chlorite from the decomposition of
biotite and hornblende.</p>

<p>It is the pink granite which by its disintegration gives rise to
much of the granitic sand which is met with in wadis and on plains.
The rock disintegrates very readily under changes of temperature,
the cleavage planes of the orthoclase aiding in the process. Change
of the felspar to kaolin goes on under weathering influences, and
the felspars become bleached, but the bulk of the disintegration is
a mechanical process, a large part of the sand consisting of
unaltered felspar.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Red pegmatitic granite</span> is closely
associated with the normal pink granite, occurring in great masses
peripherally to the latter, as for instance at Gebel Hamrat Mukbud
and in the low hills about the lower parts of Wadi Gemal and Wadi
Kreiga. The red pegmatitic granite is in fact simply an extreme
variation of the normal pink granite in which the ferro-magnesian
minerals (biotite and hornblende) are either absent or present in
very small amounts. That the rock often forms dykes is probably a
consequence of its peripheral position rather than of any special
manner of formation. The great masses such as Gebel Hamrat Mukbud
appear, like the normal granites, to have solidified under plutonic
conditions, and the dykes are off-shoots from the main mass. There
is, therefore, no reason in this locality for classifying the
pegmatites separately from the granites into a special division of
dyke-rocks, as is done by Prof. Rosenbusch, and we shall consider
the red pegmatitic granite as simply a coarse grained mica-free
granite rich in orthoclase.</p>

<p>The pegmatitic granite is usually of a far more pronounced red
colour than the normal granite. This is doubtless in part due to
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span> greater
abundance of orthoclase, but it also arises in some cases from the
orthoclase having itself a deeper colour. The rocks about the lower
parts of Wadi Gemal and Wadi Kreiga have a strong brick-red aspect.
Their proximity to the coast suggests that there may possibly be
some connexion between the intensity of their coloration and their
position near the sea; this idea is supported in some measure by
the strong red colouration of the dioritic rocks of Ras Benas,
which occupy a similar position, but the actual manner of
production of the oxide of iron which gives the colour is not
clear.</p>

</figure>
</div>
</div>

<p>In the hand specimen (<em>see</em> <a href="#pl22">Plate
XXII</a>), the red pegmatitic granite [10,389] is a coarse-grained
aggregate of red orthoclase and quartz. The quartz is generally of
grey aspect in the mass, running in strings and networks through
the felspar. The rock usually breaks easily into irregular pieces
under the hammer, owing to the facility with which the large
felspar crystals can be cleaved, but the very red variety from near
the mouth of Wadi Gemal [12,106] is extremely hard and tough, and
strikes fire very easily under the hammer. Under the microscope
(<em>see</em> <a href="#fig05">Fig. 5</a>) the red colour of the
orthoclase often persists even in the thinnest sections, being
evidently due to finely disseminated iron oxide which clouds the
felspars. The quartz shows sharply defined angular forms, and
appears to have got somewhat the start of the felspar in
crystallisation. Owing to its cloudy nature, the felspar looks like
a ground mass, and between crossed nicols shows a peculiar patchy
appearance, so that a first glance at the slide suggests a quartz
porphyry; but the whole of the patches forming a crystal extinguish
at once, and moreover the characteristic twinning of the orthoclase
can be seen in some of the crystals. A little oligoclase is also
present in addition to the orthoclase. Crushing of the rock is
frequently shown by cracked and brecciated crystals, more
especially in the hard form of the rock from Wadi Gemal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>Dykes of
pegmatitic granite are very frequent in the neighbourhood of Gebel
Hamrat Mukbud; they are typically rather paler in colour than the
larger masses, and occasionally show graphic structure.</p>

<p>In ascending Gebel Migif, the gneiss slopes of the mountain were
found to be strewn here and there with crystals of green microcline
[10,366], similar to the well-known Pike’s Peak mineral. The
crystals, which are of imperfect idiomorphic form, measuring about
one to two centimetres in length, sometimes show cross-striations
on certain faces. Though the rock was not traced <em>in situ</em>,
the crystals are doubtless derived from pegmatite dykes traversing
the gneiss.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Aplite</span>, or fine-grained binary granite
consisting essentially of quartz and felspar, with very little or
no mica or hornblende, differs from pegmatite not only in its
greater fineness of grain, but in its structure, which is
essentially granitic rather than pegmatitic, the two main minerals
being both in allotriomorphic grains. In colour, different aplites
vary with that of their felspars from red to white, and most of
them have tiny dark spots in them, sometimes only visible with a
lens, due to the presence of small quantities of hornblende or
biotite. As already mentioned on <a href="#Page_268" class=
"pginternal">p. 268,</a> most of the granites of South-Eastern
Egypt incline to the acid or aplitic type, and one is frequently in
doubt whether to classify an acid granite, such as that of Gebel
Elba for instance, as an aplite with a little hornblende, or as a
hornblende granite. Under aplites will be here considered only
those granites in which the proportion of ferro-magnesian minerals
is extremely small, not forming more than about one or two per cent
of the rock. When the definition of an aplite is thus limited,
aplites are comparatively scarce in the area.</p>

<p>Gebel Abu Hireiq consists of a red granitic rock; I did not
visit the range, but the guide sent to erect the triangulation
beacon brought back as the typical rock a pink aplite [12,134] of
rather fine grain, consisting essentially of quartz and pink
felspar, with sparsely scattered specks of hornblende.</p>

<p>The dykes [11,536] which seam the granite and diorite near where
the Wadi el Kreim joins Wadi Garara may be classed as siliceous
altered aplites. They are greyish-white to purplish-pink rocks of
rather fine grain, with a few blackish specks, the latter visible
only with a lens. The microscopic slide shows granitic quartz and
red-stained decomposed<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_273">[273]</span> matter, with a rather plentiful sprinkling
of grains and powder of iron oxide; the decomposed matter is almost
certainly the result of alteration of felspar and hornblende, the
latter in very small proportion.</p>

<p>The hill called Marwot Rod el Ligaia, near the head of Wadi
Muelih, is a boss of pink aplite, and is of interest as lying in
close connexion with certain quartz veins which are believed to be
of igneous origin (<em>see</em> <a href="#Page_266" class=
"pginternal">p. 266</a>).</p>

</div>

<p><span class="bold">Biotite-granite</span> of a well-defined type
[10,390] occurs somewhat largely in the mountains round the heads
of Wadi Abu Ghusun and Wadi el Abiad. It is a whitish rock with
dark-brown to black spots (<em>see</em> <a href="#pl22">Plate
XXII</a>). The white portion of the rock consists of quartz and
felspar; the dark spots are biotite. Generally the rock is of
medium grain, the biotite being in nests two to four millimetres
diameter scattered through the mass, giving it a speckled
appearance. Sometimes the biotite is more uniformly scattered,
giving the rock a grey aspect. At some places the rock shows signs
of crushing, this being indicated in hand specimens by a tendency
to laminar arrangement of the biotite patches. Under the microscope
(<em>see</em> <a href="#fig06">Fig. 6</a>), the felspars, which are
somewhat more abundantly present than the quartz, are seen to
consist of orthoclase and oligoclase, with here and there crystals
showing the characteristic cross hatching of microcline. The
biotite is mostly in nests and clusters of ragged-looking crystals,
but it also occurs in tiny flakes included in the felspars,
sometimes showing a distinct arrangement along the cleavage planes
of the latter. The biotite is usually fairly fresh; it is highly
pleochroic, with colour ranging from pale yellow to deep
olive-green in different positions over the nicol. Associated with
the biotite are a few wisps of colourless mica, probably muscovite,
and irregular granules of opaque iron oxides. Granules of
epidote<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span> are to be
seen in the altering felspars, and there are a few small irregular
granules of a brownish highly refracting mineral, probably
sphene.</p>

<p>A much more acid type of biotite granite [11,507] occurs in
close proximity to serpentine in low hills near the wells of Abraq.
In this the proportion of biotite is so small that the rock might
almost be classed as an aplite. It is a fine-grained white rock,
very fresh-looking, with dark spots; in hand specimens it almost
exactly resembles the hornblende granite of Gebel Elba
(<em>see</em> <a href="#pl22">Plate XXII</a>), but examination with
a lens shows the dark spots to consist of biotite instead of
hornblende. The microscopic slide shows quartz, orthoclase, and
oligoclase with granitic structure, with here and there small
straggling crystals of brown biotite; the brown biotite is
sometimes altering to chlorite with change of colour from brown to
green.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Muscovite-granite</span> is rarely met with
in South-Eastern Egypt. A specimen from Gebel Adar Qaqa<a id=
"FNanchor_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128" class=
"fnanchor">[128]</a> [12,138] is a fine-grained hard pinkish rock
of sp. gr. 2·62, composed of quartz, orthoclase, oligoclase,
muscovite, and garnet.</p>

<p>A very coarse-grained variety of muscovite-granite, in which the
individual crystals measure several centimetres across, forms white
hills to the east of Wadi Nugrus.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Hornblende-granite</span> occurs in several
forms, giving rise to rocks of different aspects in different parts
of the district.</p>

<p>The most important and widely distributed form of
hornblende-granite is a fine-grained and very acid rock of sp. gr.
2·59, which but for the manner in which it occurs might almost be
spoken of as an aplite. It is a white rock, sometimes with a
faintly pink or greenish cast, of medium to fine grain, with black
specks of hornblende about a millimetre in diameter scattered
through it (<em>see</em> <a href="#pl22">Plate XXII</a>). This rock
forms Gebels Muelih and Elba; it also occurs in the low country
round Gebel Hamrat Mukbud, and a gneissose variation of it forms
the great boss of Um Rasein. Dykes of the same rock traverse the
more basic rocks of Um Bisilla.</p>

<p>Under the microscope the rock from Gebel Elba [12,118] is seen
to consist of quartz, orthoclase, a little oligoclase, hornblende,
and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span> small
quantities of biotite (<em>see</em> <a href="#fig07">Fig. 7</a>).
The orthoclase is somewhat clouded in strips parallel to the
clino-axis of the crystals. The hornblende is in irregular grains
of sharply marked curved outlines; it is of a very deep
bottle-green colour. The accessory biotite is brown, occurring as
small wisps associated with the hornblende.</p>

<p>The rock of Gebel Muelih [10,355] is similar to that of Gebel
Elba, but the hornblende here is of an extremely pale greenish
brown colour, only slightly pleochroic, with well-marked vertical
cleavage and a very small extinction angle, so that it might be
mistaken for biotite, which latter mineral appears to be
absent.</p>

<p>Another type of hornblende-granite, differing from that last
described in being of coarser grain and containing much more
abundant hornblende, and thus having much more the appearance of an
ordinary grey granite, occurs in the lower part of Gebel Hamata and
the surrounding mountains. This rock [10,405] is slightly heavier
than the foregoing type, having a sp. gr. of 2·66. Under the
microscope (<em>see</em> <a href="#fig08">Fig. 8</a>) the
hornblende is seen to be of a dark green colour, very much altered
and clouded by separated iron oxides and epidote.</p>

<p>A third type of hornblende-granite is formed by the variation of
the normal pink granite already referred to, in which the place of
biotite is largely taken by hornblende. The mass of Gebel Mishbih
appears<a id="FNanchor_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129" class=
"fnanchor">[129]</a> to consist of a rock of this type, which
passes by insensible gradations into a syenite.</p>

<p>Under this heading are comprised rocks of granitic composition
in which porphyritic crystals of quartz, felspar, and mica are
surrounded by a fine-grained ground mass of entirely granitic
(holocrystalline) character. They differ from porphyritic granites
in the much finer grain of the general body of the rock, and from
the quartz felsites in the entire absence of glassy matter from the
ground mass. Rocks of this type are scarce in South-Eastern Egypt.
An example [12,150] occurs at the hill called Kreishim, sixteen
kilometres west of Halaib. Here the rock, which appears to form a
small boss, consists of rounded white porphyritic crystals set in a
finely crystalline grey ground mass. The sp. gr. is 2·69. Under the
microscope (<a href="#fig09">Fig. 9</a>) the porphyritic crystals
are seen to consist of quartz and oligoclase, the latter in
approximately idiomorphic crystals, often beautifully zoned; the
ground mass, of micro-granitic structure, is made up of smaller
allotriomorphic crystals of quartz, felspar, and biotite.</p>

<p>Dykes of granite-porphyry also occur traversing the granite of
Gebel Kahfa [11,537 B] and in the basic rocks of Gebel Um Bisilla
[11,518]. At both these places the rocks are far less fresh than
that above described. In the hand specimen they are of a
greyish-white or greenish-white colour, strongly resembling
fine-grained aplites in appearance. With the lens, crystals of
quartz and felspar can be made out, and specks of hornblende and
chlorite. The microscopic slides show the characteristic structure
of granite porphyry, but the felspars are all clouded by
decomposition products, and the hornblende, which is rather
sparingly present in the ground mass, is mostly changed to chlorite
and epidote. The specimen from Gebel Kahfa contains a small amount
of muscovite.</p>

<h4><span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_277">[277]</span>Quartz-felsite.</h4>

<p>Though covering only small areas, quartz-felsite is of very wide
distribution in South-Eastern Egypt. It typically forms dykes and
intrusive sheets traversing the plutonic and metamorphic rocks, but
likewise occurs occasionally in larger masses. Felsite dykes are
specially abundant in the neighbourhood of Gebels Muelih, Zergat
Naam, and Um Reit. Larger masses occur in the Wadi Huluz, and form
the summits of Gebels Nigrub el Foqani and Hamata.</p>

<p>Felsites are frequently met with in a highly altered condition.
The commonest alteration, especially in dykes, is kaolinisation of
the felspars and a clouding of the whole rock with finely
disseminated iron oxides. In some dykes traversing the granite of
Um Reit, a bleaching action has reduced the felsite to the
appearance of a limestone. In other cases the rock has been
devitrified and indurated to a high degree; this is well seen in
Gebel Igli el Iswid (latitude 25°) and at Gebel Hadarba (latitude
22°), where extensive hill-tracts consist of felsitic rocks of
almost flinty hardness.</p>

<p>The quartz-felsites are in general among the youngest of the
igneous rocks of the district, since they commonly form dykes and
intrusions, not only in the schists, but also in the granites and
other eruptive rocks.</p>

<p>The quartz-felsite of Wadi Huluz [10,394] occurs in considerable

scattered in a light greyish ground mass. The sp. gr. is 2·71.
Under the microscope the crystals of quartz are seen to have
rounded forms and to be accompanied by other porphyritic crystals
of orthoclase and oligoclase, often approximating to idiomorphic
shape (<em>see</em> <a href="#fig10">Fig. 10</a>).<span class=

specks of iron oxides. The ground mass shows a fluidal arrangement,
the little biotite flakes in it being often arranged in lines which
sweep round the porphyritic crystals. The rock has undergone
considerable alteration, the felspar crystals being clouded and
full of tiny micaceous flakes of high double refraction; the
epidote is also doubtless due to the alteration of augite and other
minerals in the ground mass.</p>

<p>The quartz-felsite which forms the upper part of Gebel Hamata
[10,906] is a dark brown coarse-textured rock, with remarkably
glassy porphyritic quartz in granules about two millimetres
diameter scattered plentifully through it. It is a very hard rock
which rings under the hammer and weathers into rusty brown blocks.
The sp. gr. is 2·71. Under the microscope the quartz crystals are
seen to be much cracked. There are also porphyritic crystals of
orthoclase and oligoclase, mostly of irregular shape, and a few
crystals, of still more irregular form, of dark green hornblende.
The cryptocrystalline ground mass consists chiefly of quartz and
felspar, through which are scattered tiny granules of dark green
hornblende. The ground mass shows a matted texture between crossed
nicols; there is no trace of fluidal movement. Like the foregoing,
this rock is somewhat altered, the hornblende in particular being
very much attacked; the felspars are fairly fresh, but the
crystals, like those of the quartz, are often cracked, and thus
show the rock to have undergone considerable crushing.</p>

<p>One of the quartz-felsite dykes traversing the schists at Gebel
Kolaiqo [12,145] is a very similar rock to that of Gebel Hamata,
except that here the ground mass, instead of being dark brown in
the hand specimen, is of a reddish brown colour (<em>see</em>
<a href="#pl22">Plate XXII</a>), and the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_279">[279]</span> porphyritic crystals are partly pink
felspar and partly glassy quartz. The sp. gr. is 2·62. Under the
microscope the quartz and felspar crystals are seen to be less
crushed than in the Hamata rock, while the ground mass, instead of
being of a matted structure, is microgranitic, with tiny elongated
grains of green hornblende scattered through it (<em>see</em>
<a href="#fig11">Fig. 11</a>).</p>

<p>Another quartz-felsite dyke at Gebel Kolaiqo [12,135] has a
rather different composition, and in the hand specimen has more the
appearance of a felspar porphyry, porphyritic white felspars being
scattered with quartz grains through a dark grey to black ground
mass (<em>see</em> <a href="#pl22">Plate XXII</a>). Its quartz
crystals frequently approximate to idiomorphic forms; they are much
corroded by the ground mass. The felspar is chiefly oligoclase, in
more or less idiomorphic crystals, a little clouded by
decomposition products. The ferro-magnesian mineral here is chiefly
brown biotite, in crystals of smaller size than those of the quartz
and felspar, scattered porphyritically through the ground mass. One
of the quartz crystals includes a crystal of biotite. The ground
mass is crystalline, and appears to consist of quartz and felspar
with a little biotite and some glassy matter.</p>

<p>A peculiar type of quartz-felsite [10,377] occurs associated
with serpentine and ophicalcites in the upper part of Gebel Ghadir.
The rock, which has a sp. gr. of 2·66, is nearly white, with a
faint greyish tinge and scattered reddish-brown specks. At first
the rock was taken for a granulite, which it very much resembles in
appearance, and the reddish-brown specks for garnet. But
examination with a lens shows the specks to be ferric oxide, and
here and there little crystals of glassy quartz can be seen. Under
the microscope the rock is found to consist mainly of an extremely
fine-grained semi-granulitic colourless ground mass in which are
sparsely scattered clear crystals of quartz, sometimes showing
corrosion, and straggling irregular patches of opaque iron oxide,
often mixed with nearly colourless wisps of mica. A few of the
clear crystals are in four-sided forms, and may possibly be
felspar; but they are perfectly free from alteration or twinning.
The iron oxide is doubtless the product of alteration of a
ferro-magnesian mineral, probably biotite. The minerals of the
ground mass are difficult of determination owing to the minuteness
of the grains and the absence of any colour, but apparently consist
of quartz, felspar, a colourless hornblende, and sericite.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>The
quartz-felsite dykes [10,356] which cut through the granite and
schists of Gebel Muelih appear as grooves in the granite, and as
back-bone ridges in the surrounding schists. They are pinkish-brown
close-textured rocks, with a dark marbling in places. The
microscopic slides show quartz and felspar in a confused ground
mass, with little flakes of a white micaceous mineral (sericite?)
aggregated round the porphyritic crystals and distributed through
the felspars and the ground mass.</p>

<p>The highly altered quartz-felsite [12,158] which forms Gebel
Butitelib, near Gebel Niqrub el Tahtani, appears to have formed a
boss or neck in the surrounding schists. The rock is a very
fine-grained grey to purplish one, in which no crystals can usually
be made out with the unaided eye. The sp. gr. is very low, being
only 2·32. Under the microscope one sees small highly corroded
crystals of quartz scattered through a clouded and glassy ground
mass. No traces of felspars can be seen, the crystals, if they
existed, having been decomposed and become undistinguishable from
the ground mass; nor can any ferro-magnesian minerals be made out,
though there are tiny granules and wisps of iron oxides which in
places show an arrangement suggestive of their having been derived
from the decomposition of such minerals.</p>

<p>The specimen [12,121] brought back from the summit of Gebel
Shendib, by the guide who was sent to erect the triangulation
beacon on it, is a compact brown rock with reddish patches, which
under the microscope appears to be an altered and brecciated
felsite.<a id="FNanchor_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130" class=
"fnanchor">[130]</a> The slide shows quartz and altered felspars in
a spherulitic ground mass, the whole of the mineral being very much
clouded by finely disseminated ferric oxide.</p>

<p>The felsite dykes [11,538] which seam the granite of Gebel Um
Reit are a still more highly altered rock. The dykes are about two
metres wide, of a white colour, and resemble limestone in
appearance; being soft, they have weathered more rapidly than the
granite around them, leaving vertical-sided chasms. But for the
manner of its occurrence, the rock would have been easily mistaken
in the field for a sedimentary one. The microscope, however,
confirms its eruptive origin. The slides cut from the rock show a
confused and clouded<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_281">[281]</span> semi-crystalline aggregate, containing
clearer small areas of quartz. Even the quartz crystals are full of
specks, and only the faintest traces can be seen of the felspars,
which are so decomposed as to be hardly distinguishable from the
ground mass.</p>

<p>In the rocks of Gebels Igli el Iswid, Mahali, and Hadarba, we
have quartz-felsites which have been altered in quite a different
way. The rocks are extremely hard, and almost flinty, breaking with
a sub-conchoidal fracture. They are typically of a brown to nearly
black colour, with white spots measuring a millimetre or two
across. Under the microscope these white spots are seen in the rock
from Gebel Igli el Iswid [10,372] to be chiefly porphyritic felspar
and quartz crystals, sometimes corroded by the ground mass; while
the black ground mass is largely composed of extremely fine
micro-pegmatitic intergrowths of quartz and felspar, with some
glassy matter, and here and there irregular small clouded and
altered crystals of hornblende. The micro-pegmatitic material has
possibly originated by devitrification of an originally glassy
ground mass. Variations of the rock occur in which the porphyritic
felspars are infrequent or even altogether absent, the rock passing
gradually into a hornfels [10,371]. The slide from Gebel Mahali
[10,402] exhibits clear porphyritic crystals of quartz and
orthoclase, both minerals in more or less idiomorphic forms,
embedded in, and occasionally corroded by, a semi-crystalline
ground mass. The ground mass contains some calcite and iron oxides,
probably arising from the decomposition of a hornblendic or
micaceous mineral.</p>

<p>The rocks of Gebel Hadarba [12,146-12,149] are essentially

of the slides the felspars show a well marked microperthitic
structure, while in others they are so decomposed that they are
barely distinguishable from the ground mass. The ground mass
sometimes contains granules and strings of iron-oxide, possibly
referable to alteration of a hornblendic constituent, but the rock
is too much altered for one to be sure.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>An altered and crushed quartz-felsite [10,404] which occurs in
the Wadi Huluz, near where the Wadi el Abiad joins it about eight
kilometres to the north-west of Gebel Hamata, somewhat resembles
the rock of Gebel Hadarba in appearance. It is a jaspery looking
rock of dark colour with red and greenish patches, in which with a
lens one can see scattered grains of glassy quartz. The slide cut
from the rock shows clear porphyritic crystals of quartz,
orthoclase and oligoclase in a fine grained ground mass. The
porphyritic crystals are mostly in rounded forms, but some of the
felspars show a tendency to idiomorphism. Many of the crystals are
smashed, and some show undulose extinction. The ground mass
consists of quartz, felspar, and some glassy matter, with abundant
epidote in nests and strings, and a small amount of green
hornblende in straggling forms.</p>

<p>The east-and-west dykes which traverse the syenite of Gebel
Zergat Naam, and form the actual summit of that mountain, consist
of a very hard compact flesh-coloured rock which weathers brown on
the surface. The microscopic section [11,525] shows the rock to
be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span> a highly
indurated felsite. The original felspar crystals can be made out by
their shapes, but between crossed nicols they are seen to consist
of a very fine-grained mosaic polarising in low greys, probably the
result of alteration by siliceous solutions. These altered felspars
are scattered with some quartz in a cryptocrystalline ground
mass.</p>

<p>No volcanic rocks of acid type have been with certainty
identified in South-Eastern Egypt. It is, however, possible that
some of the rocks above described are in reality of volcanic
origin, though the manner of their occurrence is more suggestive of
intruded masses and sheets. It is also quite likely that some of
the hornfels found associated with the schists, as for instance at
Gebel Um Semiuki, near Abu Hamamid, are altered forms of glassy
acid lavas; but their vast age and the intense metamorphism to
which they and the surrounding rocks have been subjected render it
impossible to be certain of the manner of their origin.</p>

<h5>Syenite and Syenite-porphyry.</h5>

<p>Though hornblendic varieties of granite are fairly common, true
syenite (<em>i.e.</em>, orthoclase-hornblende rocks with little or
no quartz) is amongst the rarest of rocks in South-Eastern Egypt.
It occurs near Gebel Nazla (between Bir Um Gubur and Bir Masur), in
the two remarkable conical hills called El Nahud, which rise from
the plain near the head of Wadi Natash, and at Gebel Zergat Naam.
In all these three localities the syenite appears to form intrusive
bosses rising through the surrounding rocks.</p>

<p>The specimens from near Gebel Nazla [10,625] and from El Nahud
[10,857] are very fine-grained reddish-brown rocks, which can be
seen with a lens to be largely made up of red orthoclase crystals
with dark specks of hornblende.</p>

<p class="clear space-above1">The syenite of Gebel Zergat Naam
[11,515] rises as a great boss from among the surrounding dark
schistose rocks. It is typically a pinkish-brown rock of rather
fine grain (<em>see</em> <a href="#pl23">Plate XXIII</a>), in which
can be seen shining crystals, three to four millimetres long,
of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span> pink orthoclase,
and specks of dark hornblende, with here and there a little
glassy-looking quartz. The sp. gr. is 2·62. Under the microscope
the rock is found to be mainly composed of orthoclase, with a much
smaller amount of hornblende and a little interstitial quartz. The
felspar is fairly clear, in forms approximating to idiomorphic, and
showing the characteristic simple twinning of orthoclase. The
crystals are slightly clouded in streaks parallel to the basal
planes, so that even in ordinary light a faint herring-bone
structure is visible, the streaks on either side of the trace of
the plane of composition being inclined to each other at a large
angle. Between crossed nicols this herring-bone structure is very
strongly marked, and is evidently due to a perthitic intergrowth
(of albite?). The intergrown lamellæ are slightly irregular; though
following generally the direction of the basal cleavage planes they
are not perfectly straight, nor always continuous across the half
of the crystal. The lamellæ extinguish and attain their maximum of
brightness simultaneously with the respective halves of the crystal
in which they occur, so that they become invisible in certain
positions of the nicols; but as the nicols are turned they appear
as well marked dark bands, clearly visible even under low powers.
The hornblende is of exceptionally dark green colour, in irregular
straggling masses, often considerably decomposed and clouded with
iron oxide. Accessory minerals, other than<span class="pagenum" id=

almost entirely absent in the slide examined.</p>

<p>In places, the rock of Gebel Zergat Naam takes on a finer grain
and a greyer aspect in the mass. A slide cut from this variety
[11,512] shows essentially the same composition, but the felspars
are here porphyritic in a crystalline ground mass of felspar and
hornblende. The rock thus passes into syenite-porphyry. The
porphyritic felspar crystals show the same lamellar structure as
those in the more coarsely crystalline rock.</p>

</figure>
</div>
</div>

<p>Trachyte, the volcanic representative of syenite, occurs in
dykes [11,537 A] seaming the granite of Gebel Kahfa. It is a light
grey rock, of very fine grain, breaking with a rough surface,
containing pores and small stumpy white pearly-looking porphyritic
crystals of orthoclase (<em>see</em> <a href="#pl23">Plate
XXIII</a>). The sp. gr. is 2·56. The microscope shows the ground
mass surrounding the porphyritic idiomorphic orthoclase crystals to
be a holocrystalline mixture of hornblende and felspar. The
felspars of the ground mass are usually in more elongated forms
than the porphyritic crystals, and appear to be partly plagioclase.
The hornblende, in small and very irregular crystals of dark
olive-green colour, often clouded and dirty looking, is scattered
plentifully among the feslpars of the ground mass. Accessory
primary minerals appear to be entirely absent.</p>

<p>A rock which occurs in a hill at the head of Wadi Amba-ut
[10,375] appears to be essentially similar to the above, but the
porphyritic orthoclases are more numerous and the ground mass
contains small quantities of augite and magnetite. This rock is in
a highly altered condition, the felspars being full of kaolin and
epidote, while the hornblende, which is here of a paler colour than
in the trachyte of Gebel Kahfa, is highly chloritised.</p>

<h5>Diorite.</h5>

<p>Though not forming such conspicuous features as the granites,
rocks of dioritic composition are very widely distributed over the
country, and are specially abundant in the districts to the south
of Ras Benas. They are almost always sharply marked-off from the
granites, being generally closely connected with the more basic
igneous rocks and schists. The coarser-grained varieties usually
form parts of irregular intrusive masses, shading off gradually
into the more basic forms of diabase, gabbro, and hornblende rock;
the finer-grained types occur as dykes and irregular bands
traversing other igneous rocks and schists, and are themselves
frequently so crushed as to resemble schists. Owing to their
intimate association with other dark rocks, it is no easy matter to
trace the limits of the diorites in the field. The same difficulty
is found when they are microscopically examined, for one finds in
their mineralogical composition every gradation from true diorites,
through the intermediate stage of augite-diorite to diabase and
gabbro, while many of the harder dark schists and hornblende
gneisses turn out to be merely highly crushed diorites, so that
classification must be more or less arbitrary.</p>

<p>Diorite typically forms low hill country of dark aspect. The
rock weathers as a rule far more easily than granite, and in some
cases the debris of rounded grains set free by disintegration cover
the surface and render the climbing of the hills somewhat
dangerous, the effect being like one would imagine to result from
walking over slopes covered with hard peas.</p>

<p>Diorite in the narrowest sense of the term
(plagioclase-hornblende rock) is not by any means abundant.
Curiously enough, it is generally found in the neighbourhood of old
gold mines, as for instance in the Kurdeman and Allawi districts,
and it was employed by the ancient miners for their crushing pans.
The rock from Gebel Allawi [10,313] is a medium-grained one
composed of black and milk-white minerals in about equal proportion
(<em>see</em> <a href="#pl23">Plate XXIII</a>). Its sp. gr. is
2·95. Under the microscope the milk-white material is seen to be
plagioclastic felspar, generally much decomposed, while the dark
grains are of hornblende, pale green to olive-brown in thin
section, with somewhat<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_287">[287]</span> feeble pleochroism. Like the felspar, the
hornblende is considerably altered; in places it has lost nearly
all its colour and is converted into pale green chlorite. The
accessory minerals are iron-oxides and a little sphene. Rocks of
somewhat finer grain [10,358] occur in the Rod el Ligaia. In a
slide from the last-named locality, granules of ilmenite are
surrounded by sphene, suggesting the formation of sphene by the
alteration of ilmenite. A variety of diorite [10,403] occurs in the
Wadi Huluz in which the hornblende is nearly colourless, showing
only a trace of green colour in thin section, and is accompanied by
a small amount of augite.</p>

<p>A form of diorite which occurs in and about the Wadi Baaneit
[12,151] is very similar to the rock just described, but differs
from it in the more irregular manner in which the two principal
mineral constituents are distributed. The hornblende is in patches
varying from mere specks to eight millimetres in diameter; the
felspars have a sugary appearance in the hand specimen. The sp. gr.
is 2·81.</p>

<p>A more highly specialised type of diorite [12,103] occurs in the
Wadi Muqur. This is a very beautiful heavy rock (sp. gr. 2·87),
with shining prisms of hornblende, often three centimetres or more
in length, running through a mass of white felspars (<em>see</em>
<a href="#pl23">Plate XXIII</a>). Microscopic examination reveals
the presence of some quartz mixed with the plagioclastic
felspars.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>Where the
alteration of diorite has been very intense, as in the country rock
[12,124] of the old Romit mine, the hand specimen differs from that
of the unaltered rock in that not only are the white constituents
of duller aspect, but the dark mineral, instead of being black and
shining, has a dull greenish-grey appearance. Under the microscope
one sees no trace of the original felspar, its place being taken by
calcite and a confused aggregate of small plates of kaolin and
sericite, while the hornblende is all replaced by chlorite, with
little strings of limonite. Granules of quartz, often of relatively
large size, are scattered through the mass; some of these are
clouded by minute enclosures, and evidently represent the accessory
quartz of the original rock, while others are clearer and are
probably of secondary formation.</p>

<p>Fine-grained varieties of diorite are found much more abundantly
than the normal plutonic type, occurring as irregular masses mixed
with schists and as dykes in schists and other rocks. These
fine-grained diorites are essentially similar to the
coarser-grained rocks, but are generally even more altered. The
fine-grained diorite [11,517 A], which forms the top of Gebel Um
Tenedba, for instance, consists of a mixture of clouded and altered
plagioclase and augite altering to chlorite, with separated iron
oxide along the cleavage planes of the hornblende. Another specimen
of fine-grained diorite, from a dyke in Wadi Kreiga [12,154], is
even more highly altered, the hornblende being almost entirely
chloritised, with formation of abundant little granules of
epidote.</p>

<p>The main rock of Gebel Beida [12,160] may also be classed as an
altered fine-grained diorite. It is a dark fine-grained
greenish-grey rock with white and greenish-yellow spots, usually
about two millimetres diameter, scattered through it, and abundant
strings of a greenish yellow mineral. The sp. gr. is 2·96. Under
the microscope it is seen to be of similar nature to the rocks last
described, the hornblende being largely chloritised. There is a
considerable amount of accessory augite, and this, though clouded,
has resisted alteration better than the hornblende. The whitish
spots seen in the hand specimen are made up of a fine mosaic of
quartz grains, with tiny flakes of a micaceous mineral (sericite?)
probably all of secondary origin, while the greenish-yellow strings
are other alteration products in the shape of epidote and
calcite.</p>

<h5><span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_289">[289]</span>Augite-diorite.</h5>

<p>Under the head of augite-diorite are classed holocrystalline
rocks containing, in addition to the plagioclase and hornblende of
ordinary diorites, notable quantities of augite. The
augite-diorites thus form a link between the diorites proper and
the diabases or plagioclase-augite rocks.</p>

<p>The presence of augite along with the hornblende is difficult to
ascertain in the field or in hand specimens, and can as a rule only
be detected by the microscopic examination of thin sections. But
augite diorites are generally of somewhat darker aspect than normal
diorites in the mass, owing to a less abundance of felspar, and are
generally tougher under the hammer.</p>

<p>An augite-diorite [11,535] which occurs on the pass at the head
of Wadi Um Hargal, near Gebel Kahfa, is a heavy (sp. gr. 2·87) grey
rock of medium grain, very fresh and hard, in which can be seen
lustrous black crystals mixed with a rather small quantity of white
felspars. In thin section, hornblende, the most abundant
constituent, is in fairly large allotriomorphic crystals, with well
marked cleavage and strong pleochroism (bluish-green to pale
yellow), containing abundance of irregular granules of iron oxides.
The augite, which is present to about one-third the amount of the
hornblende, is in crystals of similar size, and likewise showing
well-marked cleavage, easily distinguished by their pale brown
colour, absence of pleochroism, and higher extinction angles (about
40°); some of the crystals show irregular cracking and clouding by
decomposition products, and are surrounded by celephytic zones of
greenish matter of rather lower double refraction containing flakes
and strings of iron oxide, probably representing a marginal
alteration to hornblende. The felspar, though
considerably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>
decomposed, still shows plagioclastic twinning clearly, and appears
from the extinction angles to be an acid type of labradorite. The
rock contains considerable amount of magnetite scattered through
it, often in fairly large irregular grains, also a few small grains
of apatite, and one or two small granules of quartz.</p>

is seen weathered into rounded masses often resembling boulders, of
great hardness, and covered with a blackish-brown skin. The sp. gr.
is 2·97. Microscopic examination shows the rock, which is very
fresh, to be essentially of the same type as that last described,
but the augite is more abundant and so intimately mixed with the
hornblende as to suggest even more strongly an alteration of augite
to hornblende (<em>see</em> <a href="#fig21">Fig. 21</a>).</p>

<p>Most of the diorites of South-Eastern Egypt contain little or no
biotite as an accessory constituent. An exception occurs, however,
in a great dyke [10,391] of very fine grained diorite of sp. gr.
2·87, which traverses the granite of Gebel Abu Hegilig, and which
contains more biotite than hornblende. The dyke is so decomposed
that it is difficult to get a coherent hand specimen; but a slide
cut from one of the less altered portions shows the rock to be a
very fine grained holocrystalline one, made up of plagioclase,
biotite, hornblende, apatite and magnetite, with abundant
alteration products such as epidote,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_291">[291]</span> kaolin, and chlorite. All the minerals,
except the apatite and some of the iron oxides, are
allotriomorphic. The felspars are very much altered, but appear to
be mainly plagioclase. The biotite is in little brown
ragged-looking plates, strongly pleochroic, frequently altered with
separation of flakes of limonite. The hornblende is green, in small
and very irregular-shaped crystals, which show very little trace of
cleavage and are frequently chloritised. The apatite is in long
hexagonal clear prisms. Iron oxides, sometimes showing square or
hexagonal outlines, and epidote in granules, are liberally
scattered through the rock. From the abundance of biotite and the
fine grain and manner of occurrence of this rock it was taken in
the field for a decomposed lamprophyre; but the entire absence of
idiomorphism in the ferro-magnesian minerals show that it should
rather be placed with the diorites.</p>

<h5>Diorite-porphyrite.</h5>

<p>Rocks which may be somewhat doubtfully classed as altered
diorite-porphyrites occur at Gebel Abu Hodeid as well as near the
ruins of Um Eleiga and at Gebel Um Heshenib.</p>

</div>

<p>The triangulation point on Gebel Abu Hodeid not being an
occupied station, I have not visited the mountain, but the guide
sent to erect the beacon on the summit brought back a specimen
[12,143] of the rock. It is a very fine-grained dark grey rock with
tiny glistening specks. The sp. gr. is 2·88. The microscopic slide
shows it to consist of porphyritic plagioclase in a very
fine-grained holocrystalline ground mass composed principally of
brown hornblende and plagioclase, with a little biotite and a
plentiful sprinkling of tiny granules of iron oxides. The
porphyritic plagioclases are inclined to idiomorphic forms, forming
crystals about half a millimetre in length, and hence are not
very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span> conspicuous in
the hand specimen; they are considerably clouded by decomposition,
but still show repeated twinning very clearly. The hornblende,
which forms the main constituent of the ground mass, is of a pale
to dark yellow-brown colour, mostly in rounded granules in which
cleavage is not very strongly marked. The plagioclase of the ground
mass is likewise in tiny granules, mixed with the hornblende.
Biotite is only sparingly present in the slide; it is in tiny brown
flakes. All the minerals of the ground mass show more or less
decomposition and clouding, and contain a fairly plentiful
sprinkling of minute grains of iron oxides; flakes of this latter
substance are specially evident in the decomposing biotite.</p>

<p>The diorite-porphyrite of Um Eleiga [11,527 B] occurs associated
with fine grained gabbro round the old mines. It is a grey rock,
breaking with a rough surface, in which porphyritic lath-shaped
felspar crystals, up to three millimetres long, are somewhat
sparsely scattered in a fine-grained ground mass. The sp. gr. is
2·82. The microscopic slide reveals the ground mass to be finely
holocrystalline, composed of plagioclase and pale green to brown
hornblende, with some magnetite. The plagioclase of the ground mass
is partly in little laths, and the hornblende frequently shows a
tendency to prismatic and fibrous forms. The whole rock is in a
rather advanced state of alteration, all the crystals in the slide
being strongly clouded by kaolin and other decomposition
products.</p>

<p>The summit rock of Gebel Um Heshenib [10,392] appears to be a
highly altered basic diorite-porphyrite forming a dyke in the
surrounding schists. It is a dark-grey heavy rock (sp. gr. 3·04),
of basaltic appearance, with white porphyritic patches, more or
less rounded in form, scattered through it. The microscopic slide
shows the white patches now to consist mainly of kaolinic matter,
with which is mixed a clear mineral (sericite?), of very low
refractive index, but showing<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_293">[293]</span> rather high double-refraction colours;
while the ground mass is a very fine-grained mixture of rather
fibrous pale green hornblende with kaolinic matter. Hardly a trace
of unaltered felspar remains, but it seems natural to ascribe the
kaolin both of the porphyritic areas and of the ground mass to the
decomposition of original felspars.</p>

<p>A dyke of fine-grained brown rock which occurs in the granite of
the lower part of Wadi Kreiga [12,102] likewise appears to be an
altered diorite-porphyrite. It is much less dense than the rock
last described, its sp. gr. being only 2·68. The microscopic slide
shows the main constituent to be plagioclase felspar in idiomorphic
forms, much altered to kaolin and calcite and stained red by iron
oxide. Between the felspars are irregular patches of chloritic and
serpentinous matter, with calcite and flakes of limonite, the
alteration products of a ferro-magnesian mineral which was probably
originally hornblende.</p>

<h5>Augite-porphyrite.</h5>

<p>A dyke of augite porphyrite [10,353] occurs in the Wadi Muelih
about half-way between Gebel Muelih and Erf el Fahid. It is a
fine-grained reddish-brown rock of sp. gr. 2·79, with porphyritic
white plagioclase crystals of considerable size (up to two
centimetres in length) and other smaller porphyritic crystals of a
dark schillerized-looking mineral. The ground mass, when examined
with a hand lens, is seen to be a very fine-grained mixture of red
and dark minerals, like a syenite in miniature. The microscopic
slide reveals the dark porphyritic crystals as green hornblende,
while the ground mass is a holocrystalline mixture of plagioclase
and augite, with a little green to brown hornblende and abundance
of magnetite granules. The felspars of the ground mass are mostly
lath-shaped; they are much altered, and stained<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span> red by iron oxide. The augite,
of a very pale purple colour, is abundant in the ground mass,
sometimes in prismatic forms, but more often in rounded grains; it
is altered in places to chlorite, becoming then green in colour.
The extinction angles measured in the less-altered crystals range
to over 40°.</p>

<h5>Kersantite.</h5>

</div>
</div>

<p>Only one occurrence of a rock which can be with certainty
classed as a lamprophyre has been noted in South-Eastern Egypt. The
single occurrence referred to is that of a kersantite [11,504]
which forms a dyke cutting east-and-west through the granite of
Gebel Fereyid. In the hand specimen (<em>see</em> <a href=
"#pl23">Plate XXIII</a>) it is a fine grained dark-grey rock,
marbled with veinlets of brownish-white granular (felspathic?)
material, and containing here and there porphyritic dark-brown
platey crystals up to three millimetres in diameter. The sp. gr. is
2·81. Under the microscope, the rock presents a very fresh
appearance, and is seen to be composed mainly of felspars and brown
biotite, with a little accessory augite, green hornblende, apatite
and magnetite. The biotite, the most conspicuous constituent, is
seen partly in basal sections of perfectly idiomorphic forms, and
partly as long lath-shaped sections; it is strongly pleochroic, the
colour varying from pale yellow-brown to a very dark reddish-brown.
The felspar, which has undergone some alteration, forms a sort of
matrix round the biotite; here and there large crystals show a
tendency to idiomorphism, but the felspar is essentially
allotriomorphic. The felspar appears to be mainly oligoclase; but
there are also some crystals which show only simple twinning, and
these are doubtless orthoclase. The augite and hornblende are very
sparingly present, the former in nearly colourless to<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span> purplish crystals, the latter
in tiny forms of a deep emerald or bluish-green colour, with very
high double refraction. Magnetite is liberally scattered in small
grains through the rock, seldom included in the biotite. Apatite
occurs in very fine long needles among the felspars.</p>

<h5>Andesites.</h5>

<p>Andesites, the volcanic representatives of the diorites, are
much more scarce in the south portion of the Eastern Desert than
they are further north. In the district here treated of, only a
single deposit, that of Gebel Sufra, has been noted as belonging
certainly to the class of andesitic lavas. Some other volcanic
rocks consisting chiefly of hornblende and plagioclase have been
met with, as for instance at the hill of Ti Keferiai and in the
Wadi Huluz; but these are of so basic a nature that they are more
properly classed as hornblende-basalts. It is also practically
certain that some of the rocks which must be classed as schists on
account of their structure are metamorphosed andesites; among the
schists of the Wadi Muelih, for example, are rocks which in thin
section present a ground mass still distinctly andesitic in
character, but the hornblendic constituent, instead of forming
well-defined porphyritic crystals as it doubtless originally did,
is dragged out into fibrous forms, and the same action can be
traced in the hornblendes of the ground mass.</p>

<p class="space-below1">The andesite of Gebel Sufra [10,597] occurs
as a columnar deposit overlying syenites and diorites at the top of
the mountain, which rises to 690 metres above sea-level in latitude
24° 39′. The rock, which is a fine-grained greenish-grey one
weathering to a brown colour on exposed surfaces, often shows a
banded structure (<em>see</em> <a href="#pl23">Plate XXIII</a>).
The sp. gr. is 2·67. The microscopic section shows the rock to be
highly altered, but sufficient traces of its original nature can be
made out to leave little doubt of its being an andesitic lava. The
slides show porphyritic felspars in a cryptocrystalline ground mass
composed of felspar with a little hornblende and biotite. The
porphyritic felspars are too much kaolinised for twinning to be
made out, but a little calcite is visible in their decomposition
products, and the crystals are in rather elongated forms which
suggest plagioclase rather than orthoclase. The minerals of the
ground mass are likewise much decomposed, but tiny grains of green
hornblende and wisps of brown<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_296">[296]</span> biotite, both altering to chlorite, can be
seen. There is an almost complete absence of primary iron oxides,
but a single large porphyritic crystal in the slide shows separated
hæmatite in flakes and in strings down its cleavage planes. The
nature of this single crystal is not very clear, and it is doubtful
if any of its original substance remains; its form and cleavage are
suggestive of augite, but the clear spaces unoccupied by the iron
oxide have the appearance of quartz or clear felspar under crossed
nicols.</p>

<h3 class="hvar"><a id="c09s4"></a>BASIC IGNEOUS ROCKS.</h3>

<h4>Gabbro.</h4>

<p>Gabbros (or plutonic plagioclase-pyroxene rocks with or without
olivine) are widely distributed in South-Eastern Egypt, entering
largely into the composition of some conspicuous mountains such as
Gebels Atut, Madaret Um Gamil, Um Gunud, Um Bisilla, Dahanib, Gerf,
and Hadal Aweib Meisah, and also occurring in smaller patches at
various other points.</p>

<p>Though they are all dark-coloured, tough and heavy rocks
(specific gravity from 2·8 to 3·2), the gabbros vary very much in
appearance at different places owing to variations in size of grain
and in mineral composition. Thus we have every gradation from the
coarse-grained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>
gabbros such as those of Um Bisilla and Gerf, where the individual
crystals measure sometimes two or three centimetres in length,
through the medium grained rocks of Atut, Dahanib and Hadal Aweib
Meisah, to the granulitic gabbro of Kolmanab hill, of which the
grain is so fine that the rock looks almost like a basalt. In
mineral composition, the gabbros show likewise great variety. Some,
like the rocks of Um Bisilla, are relatively rich in felspar, and
are lighter both in colour and in weight than others in which the
pyroxenes predominate; in some cases the proportion of felspar
almost vanishes and the rock passes into a pyroxenite. Some of the
gabbros, such as those of Atut, contain olivine, while others, such
as the rocks of Gebel Dahanib, do not. The nature of the pyroxene
varies, being sometimes almost entirely diallage, while in others
it is mainly ordinary augite, and in others, again, rhombic
pyroxenes such as bronzite and hypersthene occur. A further
variation is the presence of hornblende in some gabbros, either as
an accessory primary constituent or as an alteration product of a
pyroxene. In the uppermost rock of Gebel Um Bisilla we have an
example of troctolite, a form of gabbro in which there is no
pyroxene but only felspar and olivine.</p>

<p>In the field, mountains and hills formed of gabbro are typically
of dark aspect, though frequently less dark than a freshly broken
surface of the rock, owing to a film of iron-oxide which forms on
weathered faces. This film is most strongly marked in the
olivine-bearing varieties of the rock; it is very thin, good sound
rock being usually found at a depth of a millimetre or so below the
exposed surfaces. In form, hills of gabbro are usually in the form
of flattish cones and ridges, whose surfaces and summits are
covered with a debris of rusty-looking weathered blocks of the
rock. This blocky type of summit is well seen at Gebel Atut
(<em>see</em> the view on <a href="#pl10">Plate X,</a> p. 172).</p>

<p>Though sometimes sharply marked-off from the adjacent rocks,
gabbros, when traced laterally in the field, are most frequently
found to pass gradually into more basic forms such as pyroxenites,
amphibolites, and serpentines. It is not always easy in the field
to distinguish between augite or diallage and hornblende, and one
or two rocks which were taken for gabbros turn out on microscopic
study to be really basic diorites or hornblende-rocks; while a rock
at Um Eleiga, which strongly resembles a rather fine-grained
diorite in appearance, turns out to be a gabbro. The limit between
gabbros and peridotites<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_298">[298]</span> is exceptionally difficult to map, the
proportions of olivine, augite, bronzite, and felspar changing very
frequently in the same rock mass, as for instance at Gebel
Gerf.</p>

<p>Almost all the gabbros contain a considerable amount of
magnetite as an accessory constituent, and in some cases, as at
Gebel Hadal Aweib Meisah, magnetite is present in such quantity as
to render the rock strongly magnetic. Compass readings in the
neighbourhood of large masses of gabbro are almost always subject
to more or less error from this cause. In the case of a gabbro
discovered by Dr. Hume to the west of Gebel Ranga, near the coast
about latitude 24° 24′, concentration of the ferruginous matter has
gone on to such a degree as to give rise to deposits of hæmatite
containing 39 per cent of iron.<a id="FNanchor_132"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p>

<p>Perhaps the most striking feature evident in the microscopic
slides cut from the gabbros is the remarkable freshness of the
felspars in most of the specimens, which, taken in conjunction with
the basic nature of the rocks, inclines one to consider the basic
rocks as probably on the whole amongst the youngest of the plutonic
masses. Another characteristic feature is “celephytic” structure,
in which a shell of green hornblende is found to surround the iron
oxides and pyroxenes when they are embedded in, or in contact with,
the surrounding felspar.</p>

<p>A typical olivine-free gabbro [11,509] forms the main rock of
Gebel Dahanib. A specimen taken from the summit, where the rock is
rather finer in grain than that of the rest of the mountain, is
very hard and heavy (sp. gr. 3·15), and is formed of a mixture of
dark dull-looking mineral with shining white to colourless
felspars. Under the microscope it is seen to be a holocrystalline
aggregate of fairly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>
fresh labradorite and pyroxene, both in allotriomorphic forms, in
about equal proportions. About half the pyroxene is in the form of
diallage, the remainder being mostly ordinary augite; it is almost
colourless in thin section, but some of the crystals show a slight
pleochroism, colourless to pale pinkish-brown. The augite crystals
are much cracked, and frequently show signs of alteration with
formation of calcite, epidote and serpentinous matter. There are a
few small irregular areas of very pale green hornblende mixed with
the augite, of which they may possibly be products of alteration.
One or two elongated crystals in the slide, barely distinguishable
from the augite under ordinary light, show a fibrous structure and
straight extinction with low double-refraction colours; these are
probably bronzite. There are only a few very tiny grains of iron
oxide, and olivine appears to be absent from the slide
examined.</p>

<p>A fine grained gabbro free from olivine occurs associated with
diorite round the old mines of Um Eleiga [11,527 A]. It is a
speckled black-and-white rock which would at first sight be taken
for a fine-grained diorite rather than a gabbro. Its sp. gr. is
2·93. On microscopic examination the rock is found to be a
holocrystalline aggregate of plagioclase, augite, altered
hornblende, and magnetite, with granitic structure. The plagioclase
(labradorite) is considerably altered and clouded by kaolinic
matter, especially near the centres of the crystals, but still
shows its characteristic twinning clearly. The augite, which is
sometimes in the form of diallage, is fairly abundant, mostly in
irregular grains, though occasionally inclining to prismatic forms;
it is nearly colourless, but much cracked and slightly clouded. A
clouded pale green to brown mineral, which sends off long tongues
into cracks in the surrounding felspars, is also fairly abundant.
This mineral polarises in yellows and greys as a confused
serpentine-like aggregate of minute fibres, but contains clear and
nearly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span> colourless
areas representing the original mineral from which it is derived;
these clear areas, in which prismatic cleavage is usually well
marked, are sometimes augite, but in many cases they polarise in
lower colours (greys and yellows) than the augite, with low
extinction angles, and are probably hornblende. Magnetite is very
abundant in quite large irregular grains, often surrounded by a
thin shell of hornblende or of the clouded alteration product just
mentioned. There are a few small six-sided prisms of apatite,
mostly included in the felspars.</p>

<p>Another variety of fine-grained gabbro, likewise free from
olivine, but containing hypersthene and some hornblende [12,126],
forms the upper portion of Hadal Aweib Meisah, and a very similar
rock [11,521] occurs in the hills five kilometres south-south-west
of Marwot Elemikan. The rock is very hard, of a grey colour on
fracture, weathering to blocks which have a rusty-brown skin. Its
sp. gr. is 2·98. It is highly magnetic, and causes great
disturbance of the compass needle in its neighbourhood. The hand
specimen shows a mixture of shining white felspars with duller
black minerals (<em>see</em> <a href="#pl24">Plate XXIV</a>). On
microscopic study, the rock is found to be a holocrystalline
aggregate of plagioclase, augite, hypersthene, hornblende and
magnetite. The plagioclase, which forms about two-thirds of the
rock, is a very clear and fresh labradorite of a rather acid type.
The augite is usually in more or less rounded grains, often
aggregated into irregular strings and mixed with hypersthene and
magnetite. Only in a few cases does the augite show diallagic
lamellation. It is nearly colourless, with a slight greenish or
pinkish-brown tinge and faint pleochroism. The prismatic cleavages
are usually distinct, and in addition the crystals are irregularly
cracked. Twinning is fairly frequent, as also are inclusions of
magnetite in the augite. The hypersthene occurs in grains similar
to those of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>
augite, with which it is mixed, and from which at first sight it is
not easily discriminated; but it can be picked out by its more
marked pleochroism, straight extinction, and lower double
refraction. Magnetite is abundant in large irregular grains, and in
smaller granules included in the augite. Hornblende occurs in
subordinate amount to the other minerals, and is principally seen
as a celyphitic zone round the magnetite and augite crystals,
especially between these crystals and the felspars. It is usually
fairly clear, strongly pleochroic (deep greenish-brown to very pale
yellowish-brown), and where surrounding two or three grains of
other minerals the whole zone extinguishes at once, showing it to
be a single crystal.</p>

<p>The main portion of Gebel Um Bisilla is formed of a gabbro
[11,514] containing a relatively small proportion of pyroxene and a
considerable amount of olivine. In the mass, it is a hard tough
rock, consisting of a mixture of white to greenish felspars,
showing plagioclastic twinning with the lens, with dull dark
minerals, some of a greenish colour and others of a rusty-brown
appearance (<em>see</em> <a href="#pl24">Plate XXIV</a>). The sp.
gr. of the rock is 2·8. The labradorite, which forms about
two-thirds of the whole, is very fresh, but is here and there
decomposed with formation of calcite along cracks. The pyroxenic
constituent is now mostly represented by dusty looking very pale
greenish-brown straggling crystals interstitial to the felspars; it
appears to have been originally diallage, but is in an advanced
stage of alteration, polarising as a confused fibrous mass of
hornblende and chlorite, with irregular banding in a direction
inclined at about 30° to the general direction of the fibres. The
olivine is in large rounded grains, nearly colourless where
unaltered, showing the usual irregular cracks; some of the grains
are altered to yellowish-green serpentine, with separation of
granules of iron oxide.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>Of the
fine-grained olivine-gabbros, one of the principal types is the
rock of Gebel Atut and Madaret Um Gamil [10,365]. It is a dark
heavy rock, weathering into angular blocks with a thin rusty skin,
of great hardness and ringing under the hammer. On a fresh
fracture, it is seen to be made up of white glassy felspars and
dark brownish minerals, some of which have a platey structure with
cleavage surfaces which flash as the specimen is turned about in
the sunlight. The sp. gr. is 3·01. Microscopic examination shows
the rock to be a holocrystalline aggregate of plagioclase
(labradorite), augite, hornblende and olivine, with a very little
magnetite. The labradorite, which forms about half the rock, is
very clear and fresh, in large crystals which frequently show a
tendency to idiomorphism. Smaller crystals of labradorite are
frequently included in the augite and hornblende. Augite, the next
most abundant constituent after the felspar, is present in
irregular almost colourless grains with well marked cleavage and
numerous irregular cracks, and sometimes slightly clouded. The
extinction angles measure up to 36°. The hornblende is in some
crystals of a rather pale greenish-brown colour not showing very
strong pleochroism, while in others it is more strongly coloured,
varying from a rather deep reddish-brown to very pale
yellowish-brown when turned over the nicol. The hornblende and
augite are frequently associated in such a manner as to suggest
that much of the hornblende in the rock originated from alteration
of augite. The olivine is fairly abundant in large rounded grains,
with the usual blackened irregular cracks; it is mostly fresh, but
here and there are patches converted into nearly colourless
serpentine with separation of numerous granules of iron oxide.</p>

<p>Another olivine-gabbro [10,412], which forms a hill rising from
the plain about eleven kilometres east of Gebel Selaia, resembles
that of Gebel Atut, but is rather coarser in grain and contains
less plagioclase,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span> a
larger proportion of hornblende, and probably a little accessory
hypersthene. It is a dense dark and tough rock of sp. gr. 3·17,
containing large black schillerized-looking crystals sometimes
measuring one centimetre across, and a liberal sprinkling of white
plagioclase with a few tiny grains of pyrite. Under the microscope,
very clear and fresh labradorite is seen to form less than
one-third of the rock; the crystals, which are mostly of irregular
outline, are frequently enclosed in the hornblende. The hornblende
occurs very abundantly as larger irregular green and brown
crystals, with well-marked prismatic cleavage; it often encloses
crystals of all the other minerals, forming a pseudo-celephytic
border round the enclosed augite and olivine. Augite is somewhat
less abundant than the hornblende, with which it is intergrown, in
pale pinkish-brown crystals, slightly pleochroic, with very
distinct vertical cleavage and irregular cracks. Twinning is not
very frequent. The extinction angles are usually under 30°. A few
crystals which show slightly stronger pleochroism (pinkish-brown to
very pale green) than the ordinary augite, and straight extinction,
are probably hypersthene. Olivine is present in about equal
quantity with the augite, in large irregular grains, much cracked,
but otherwise fairly fresh, polarising in brilliant colours; the
cracks are blackened with separated iron oxide, but there is very
little serpentinisation. There are a few small grains of pyrite and
magnetite, but iron ores are not nearly so conspicuous as in some
of the other rocks of this class.</p>

<h4>Troctolite.</h4>

<p class="cp3">Fig. 34.—Troctolite of Gebel Um Bisilla [11,522], ×

expansion has crushed the surrounding clear plagioclase crystals
(<em>pl</em>), forming large numbers of curved cracks into which
little tongues of serpentine project.</p>
</figure>
</div>
</div>

<p>If the gabbro of Gebel Um Bisilla is followed towards the
summit, a diminution in the pyroxenic content, with a corresponding
increase in the proportion of olivine, is noted, and at the top of
the mountain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span> we
have a troctolite, or rock composed essentially of plagioclase and
olivine [11,522]. It is a heavy speckled black-and-white rock, made
up of colourless to milky and greyish-black grains about three
millimetres diameter (<em>see</em> <a href="#pl24">Plate XXIV</a>).
Its sp. gr. is 2·84. The rock looks like a diorite in the hand
specimen; it weathers to rusty looking blocks of remarkable
hardness. Under the microscope the mineral which looks
greyish-black in the hand specimen is found to be olivine,
colourless where unaltered in thin section; but the usual
alteration to serpentine has gone on along irregular cracks, and
the separated granules or iron oxide give the black colour to the
mass. The felspar, which forms considerably more than half the
rock, is a very fresh, though occasionally much cracked,
labradorite. Both the constituent minerals are present in
allotriomorphic grains.</p>

<h4>Pyroxene-granulite.</h4>

</figure>
</div>
</div>

<p>The rock [12,132] forming the hill called Kolmanab, which rises
from the coast-plain in latitude 22° 32′, resembles the
fine-grained olivine free gabbros very closely in composition, but
on account of its marked granulitic structure, is termed a
pyroxene-granulite. The rounded form of the grains has probably
been conditioned by movement of the magma during consolidation, but
the rock contains no garnet or other typically metamorphic mineral,
and there appears to be no reason for regarding this particular
granulite as other than an igneous rock. It will have been noted
that the augite grains in some of the fine grained gabbros show a
marked tendency to granulitic forms, and the rock of Kolmanab
appears to be merely an example of this tendency extending to the
other constituents. The field relations are such as to suggest an
intrusive boss. The rock is very<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_305">[305]</span> hard and heavy, greyish-black and
basaltic-looking; fresh fractures show tiny glistening grains when
turned about in the hand. Its sp. gr. is 3·13. Microscopic
examination shows it to be essentially a granulitic mixture of
augite and plagioclase with a considerable amount of magnetite, and
a little hornblende. All the minerals are of remarkable freshness,
in rounded grains about a tenth of a millimetre in diameter. The
augite, which forms about half the rock, is of a very pale green
colour, sometimes showing faint traces of pleochroism with the same
pinkish tints as hypersthene, from which, however, it is easily
distinguished by its high extinction angles. It encloses abundant
rounded colourless granules, which appear to be felspar. The
felspar is an acid labradorite, and forms a mosaic among the augite
grains; besides the twinned crystals, there are others which show
no trace of this feature, and some of these may possibly be quartz.
Hornblende occurs, not very abundantly, in larger crystals than the
other constituents, grains of which it frequently encloses; it is
of an olive-green colour. Magnetite is scattered through the entire
rock in rounded grains, and is specially frequent enclosed in the
hornblende.</p>

<h4>Diabases.</h4>

<p>Under the heading of diabase are included plagioclase-augite
rocks, with or without olivine, of a character intermediate between
gabbro and basalt. They differ from the gabbros in their finer
grain, in the general absence of diallagic structures in the
augite, and in the more or less porphyritic nature of their
felspars, which are often ophitically intergrown with the augite.
They differ from basalts, on the other hand, in being of coarser
grain, and typically containing no glassy matter. The diabases of
South-Eastern Egypt are more closely allied to the volcanic
division of the basic rocks (basalts) than to the<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span> plutonic (gabbros), and many
of the rocks here classed as diabases would be called dolerites by
some English writers.</p>

<div class="box-float float-left">

limonite. The rock also contains large porphyritic felspars, not
shown in the figure.</p>
</figure>
</div>
</div>

<p>Perhaps the most interesting occurrence of diabase in this part
of Egypt is a thick bed underlying the Nubian sandstone and exposed
along the feet of its eastern scarps between latitudes 24° 30′ and
25°. Owing to the north-westerly trend of the scarp, it is cut
obliquely by the meridian of 34°, and consequently only the
southern portion of the deposit is shown on the geological map of
<a href="#pl20">Plate XX.</a> The bed is well seen on the west of
the road leading from Baramia to Dungash mines; this road follows
the foot of the scarp for a long distance. The thickness of the
diabase sheet as seen on this road is at least ten metres, and is
very uniform for several kilometres. The rock is crushed and
decomposed to such a degree that it is difficult to get a
fair-sized specimen. Below the diabase, at a few points along the
road, there are exposures of an ancient conglomerate of dark colour
and extreme hardness. The relations of the bed to the sandstone are
not absolutely certain, but the impression I got, when I passed the
exposure on the two occasions of my outward and return marches, was
that the diabase was an extensive outflow over the old conglomerate
(thus indurating the latter), the sandstone being subsequently laid
down on the undenuded diabase. The diabase is thus probably
Cretaceous in age. A hand specimen [10,417] from one of the least
decomposed portions of the sheet, in the Rod el Nagi, about fifteen
kilometres west of Gebel Muelih, shows white to glassy porphyritic
felspar crystals, frequently in lath-shaped forms measuring up to
eight millimetres in length, in a fine-grained grey ground mass
(<em>see</em> <a href="#pl24">Plate XXIV</a>). The rock contains
many rusty specks, and occasionally as one turns the specimen about
in the hand one can catch a rather dull flash from a crystal of
some dark mineral. The sp. gr. of the rock is 2·85. Under the
microscope the porphyritic felspars, which are very<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span> clear, are seen to be mostly
plagioclase, though some of the crystals show simple twinning and
may be orthoclase. The ground mass is holocrystalline, composed of
felspar, augite, and limonite. The felspars of the ground mass are
in the form of thin laths, with repeated twinning. The augite is
nearly colourless, with a very pale brownish or greenish tinge,
generally clouded by brown dusty matter and small irregular cracks.
It forms irregular grains which are cut up in all directions by the
ophitically intergrown felspars. The limonite is extremely
abundant, scattered through the ground mass in rather large
irregular grains which frequently show a tendency to square or
hexagonal outlines; it is mostly opaque, but in some parts it is
translucent, with a deep brown colour. The limonite is doubtless an
alteration product of other minerals, probably magnetite and
biotite, of which, however, no distinct traces now remain.</p>

<p>Besides forming the sheet under the Nubian sandstone, diabase
occurs fairly abundantly in schists at various points, where it
appears to form intrusions. A characteristic of these occurrences
is its weathering into rusty looking brown “cannon balls.” Altered
forms of diabase are associated with peridotites and other ultra
basic rocks in the serpentine mass of Gebel Gerf (<em>see</em>
<a href="#Page_328" class="pginternal">p. 328</a>). Diabase also
forms veins, frequently magnetic, penetrating granites and schists,
and at one point, near the foot of Gebel Awamtib, a dyke of diabase
is even found penetrating the Nubian sandstone.</p>

<p>It is probable that these diabases are of very different ages at
different points. While the occurrences associated with the
sandstone are certainly of Cretaceous age, it seems difficult to
imagine that those associated with the schists and serpentines are
not vastly older; for though they are obviously younger than the
schists, and possibly younger than the peridotites, they frequently
show metamorphism to a degree which it is difficult to reconcile
with a Cretaceous age, and which suggests that they antedated the
folding which formed the ancient mountain chain on the flanks of
which the Cretaceous strata were laid down.</p>

<p>As an example of a diabasic intrusion with “cannon ball”
weathering, we may take the rock [10,400], which occurs in schists
on the flanks of Gebel Abu Hamamid. When one of the rusty looking
“cannon balls” is broken, the interior is seen to be a dark grey
rock of very fine grain. The sp. gr. is 2·93. The microscopic slide
shows<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span> the rock to
be holocrystalline, consisting mainly of augite and plagioclase,
ophitically intergrown, with some rather large grains and strings
of a nearly isotropic clear yellow-green mineral, and scattered
grains of iron oxides. The augite is of a pale brown colour; some
of the crystals are fairly clear, while others show strong clouding
and separation of iron oxide. The nature of the yellow-green
mineral is somewhat uncertain; it polarises generally in very low
colours, as an aggregate of fibres and tiny plates, sometimes
showing a spherulitic structure between crossed nicols.
Occasionally it includes granules of a highly refracting colourless
mineral, possibly olivine; but there is a remarkable absence of the
separated iron oxide which is usual with altering olivine, and the
granules exhibit only very fine irregular hairlike cracks; if it is
serpentine resulting from alteration of olivine, the olivine must
have been a variety poor in iron.</p>

</div>

<p>Turning now to the occurrence of diabase in dykes, a large dyke
in the gneiss at the junction of Wadis Huluz and Gemal [10,393]
consists of a very hard and heavy, strongly magnetic, greyish black
rock of rather fine grain, in which a dark-brown platey mineral is
mixed with grey and white matter. The sp. gr. is 2·95. Under the
microscope the constituents are seen to be plagioclase, olivine,
augite and magnetite, with small amounts of biotite and apatite.
The plagioclase appears<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_309">[309]</span> to have formed in two generations, for
while the bulk of it is in small lath-shaped crystals (frequently
with radial grouping), there is a very large porphyritic zoned
crystal in the slide. The olivine is in large crystals, usually
rounded, but occasionally tending to hexagonal outline with the
usual strongly marked black irregular cracks. A little
serpentinisation has gone on at the edges and along cracks of a few
of the crystals, but, as a rule, the olivine is very fresh; it is
never intergrown with felspars. The augite is slightly pleochroic,
of a purple to brown tint, in irregular forms, partly in moderate
sized crystals and partly in tiny grains in the ground mass. The
crystals are much cracked. Ophitic structures are not conspicuous.
Brown biotite is very sparingly present in small flakes. Magnetite
is liberally scattered in small grains in the augite of the ground
mass. Apatite occurs in minute prisms included in the felspars.</p>

<p>The diabase dykes which penetrate the granite in Wadi Kreiga
[12,110] differ from the rock last described in their freedom from
olivine and in showing marked ophitic structure. They are dense
brown to black rocks of very fine grain, with porphyritic felspar
crystals here and there. The sp. gr. is 2·98. Microscopic study
shows them to be holocrystalline rocks, composed of an ophitic
mixture of rod-shaped plagioclase with altering augite and
hornblende. Both the ferro-magnesian minerals are very much
clouded, and contain plentiful strings of iron oxide. The
hornblende is dark green, often forming celephytic shells round the
augite, and is probably largely an alteration from augite. There is
very little of the nature of a ground mass, the augite and
hornblende practically filling all the spaces between the
felspars.</p>

<p>The rock which forms the top of Gebel Um Khariga [10,373]
appears to be an altered mica-diabase. It is highly magnetic; the
compass was found to point 20° out of its normal position at the
station on the hill, while hand specimens broken off the rock
showed strong polarity, some parts attracting and other parts
repelling the needle; a fragment of the size of a pea deflected the
compass needle several degrees when placed near it. It is a dark
brown rock, of sp. gr. 2·83, very rotten, which in the mass looks
like an altered dolerite. Microscopic study of a slide reveals the
presence of altered plagioclase, in rather large lath-shaped
crystals; biotite, largely altered to opaque iron oxide, the flakes
of which show marked geometric forms; scattered grains of
magnetite, and some secondary calcite. The brown clouded mineral
polarises as a confused fine-grained and fibrous aggregate in low
colours; it is probably altered augite, with which the plagioclases
were ophitically intergrown, but is in too highly altered a state
for certain identification. The strongly magnetic character of the
rock would appear to indicate that the iron oxides produced by the
alteration of the biotite are, like the primary grains, in the form
of magnetite.</p>

<h4>Basalt.</h4>

<p>Basalt, the volcanic representative of the gabbros and diabases,
is quite a scarce rock in South-Eastern Egypt, having been noted at
only four or five points. Fairly fresh olivine-basalts, probably
comparatively late intrusions, form the two conspicuous low hills
near the coast called Gimeida and Einiwai; more altered rocks of
basaltic type occur at the head of Wadi Um Deheisi (north of Gebel
Kahfa), and in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span>
hills on either side of the Wadi Huluz some ten kilometres
north-west of Gebel Hamata; while an amygdaloidal rock which forms
a large part of the hill-mass of Ti Keferiai has been classed as an
altered hornblende-basalt.</p>

the absence of porphyritic felspars. It occurs capping the red
granite which forms the lower part of Einiwai Hill and the
surrounding plain. It is a hard dull black rock with little glassy
colourless to pale green crystals plentifully scattered through it
(<em>see</em> <a href="#pl24">Plate XXIV</a>). The sp. gr. is 3·10.
The microscopic slide shows porphyritic crystals of olivine,
augite, and picotite, in a very fine-grained semi-glassy ground
mass containing tiny laths of felspar and grains of augite and
magnetite. The porphyritic crystals all show a remarkable absence
of colour in the slide, which has been cut exceptionally thin on
account of the darkness of the ground mass; this thinness of the
slide doubtless accounts for the minerals all showing relatively
low polarisation colours. The porphyritic crystals are mostly in
six-sided and prismatic forms, but sometimes show as rounded
grains; cleavage is usually indistinct, but irregular cracks are
common, and some of the crystals are broken in two and the halves
separated. Most of the six-sided crystals show straight extinction,
and are probably a non-ferruginous olivine
(forsterite);<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span> they
show very little alteration, there being a general absence of
serpentinisation or magnetite-separation along the cracks. The
prismatic porphyritic crystals are in forms resembling those of
augite, and some of the crystals show extinction sufficiently
oblique to justify their identification as augite; others, however,
showing straight extinction and very low polarisation colours, are
probably enstatite. The picotite is in rather large isotropic
rounded grains, of a pale green colour with a well marked opaque
border of chromite.</p>

<p>A peculiar basaltic rock [10,408] occurs at the top of Wadi Um
Deheisi, at the pass into Wadi Um Retba, on the road which passes
from Bir Shadli to the north-east of Gebel Kahfa. It is a black
rock of sp. gr. 2·98, and of such fine grain that practically
nothing can be made out with a lens. It is remarkably magnetic, the
compass being deflected by 13° from its normal direction at a
plane-table station on the pass. The microscopic slide shows
rounded and angular clear areas in a cryptocrystalline ground mass
of greenish colour, full of specks of magnetite. The rounded clear
areas are occupied by a very pale brownish mineral, probably
augite, forming nests of crystals in different orientations, with
fairly well-marked cleavages, high extinction-angle and fairly high
double refraction. The angular clear areas are mostly colourless;
they seem to consist chiefly of altered felspar, but some of them
are formed of a fine mosaic of quartz granules. The ground mass is
largely of chloritic nature, with small fibres of hornblende and
some decomposed felspar. Its large content of rounded magnetite
granules accounts for the magnetic character of the rock.</p>

<p>The basalt of the Wadi Huluz [10,410] is a close grained
greenish-black rock containing white spots (amygdules) up to three
millimetres diameter. Its sp. gr. is 2·93. The microscope shows the
main bulk of the rock to be formed of lath-shaped plagioclase
crystals, around and between which is green matter, now mostly
chlorite. Here and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[313]</span>
there are small clear areas within the green patches, which show
bright polarisation colours, and are probably augite, being the
remains of the original mineral which has been largely chloritised.
There is a fair amount of magnetite in scattered grains. The
amygdules are partly filled with clear quartz, and partly with
zeolites.</p>

<p>The hill mass of Ti Keferiai is largely made up of a
fine-grained black rock [12,120], of sp. gr. 2·99, in which are
greenish-white and pink amygdules up to two millimetres diameter.
It is frequently much crushed, and in one place it has been broken
into a coarse breccia and cemented with rose quartz [12,123]. The
microscopic slide shows the main part of the rock to be a
fine-grained mixture of pale hornblende with altered plagioclase,
while the amygdules are filled with radiating zeolites. The
amygdules seem to indicate that the rock is a volcanic one, and it
has been classed as a basalt rather than as an andesite on account
of its basic nature and high specific gravity. Its texture is
microgranitic rather than basaltic, a circumstance perhaps in part
due to the crushing it has undergone; the rock is passing into a
schist.</p>

<h3><a id="c09s5"></a>Ultra-basic Igneous Rocks.</h3>

<p>The ultra-basic igneous rocks (<em>i.e.</em>, rocks practically
free from felspar and composed entirely of ferro-magnesian
silicates such as pyroxenes, amphiboles, and olivines), though
forming but a small part of the earth’s crust in general, occur in
very large proportion in the igneous masses of South-Eastern Egypt,
where they cover several hundred square kilometres and form
prominent mountain-masses such as those of Gebels Dahanib,
Korabkansi, and Gerf. They may be classified into:—</p>

<p class="hang1-pad">(<em>a</em>) <em>Pyroxenites</em> (rocks
composed essentially of pyroxenes);</p>

<p class="hang1-pad">(<em>b</em>) <em>Amphibolites</em> (rocks
composed essentially of hornblende);</p>

<p class="hang1-pad">(<em>c</em>) <em>Peridotites</em> (rocks
composed essentially of olivine, with or without pyroxenes and
amphiboles);</p>

<p class="pad3">All these ultra-basic rocks are easily altered
to</p>

<p class="hang1-pad">(<em>d</em>) <em>Serpentines</em>, in which
the original minerals may or may not be traceable.</p>

<p>A characteristic of the ultra-basic rocks here, as in other
parts of the world, is their gradual transition into one another,
showing that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span> the
various forms have arisen from consolidation of parts of one and
the same magma owing to slight differences in composition or in the
physical conditions under which consolidation has taken place. A
further noteworthy circumstance is their gradual passage into basic
rocks; there is no hard-and-fast line to be drawn, for instance,
between basic diorites and amphibolites, nor between basic gabbros
and pyroxenites, nor between olivine gabbros, poor in felspar and
peridotites, these various classes being found to pass by
insensible gradations one into another as they are followed up in
the field. Moreover, being typically coarse-grained rocks, and
pyroxenes and amphiboles being often indistinguishable in the hand
specimen, great caution has to be exercised in naming a rock mass
from a few microscopic slides which of necessity each embrace at
most but a few square centimetres of section.</p>

<p>In the field, the appearance and cohesive strength of the
ultra-basic rocks varies primarily with the extent to which they
have been altered towards their final stage of serpentinisation.
Where they are least altered, they form black masses of hard heavy
crystalline rock of such toughness that they are only broken with
difficulty with a sledge hammer; while in the cases where
serpentinisation has proceeded to the greatest extent, they
frequently form foxy red or even pink-looking hills which might
almost be taken for granite from a distance, and they are so
shattered that the rock comes off literally in tons at a mere
touch; in these cases, long search is necessary to find a coherent
piece large enough for a museum specimen. The brown or pink colour
just referred to is of course only superficial, but in the
untrodden and rainless wilderness surface films remain unbroken and
give characteristic colours to the scenery. Freshly fractured
surfaces are always dark green, dark brown, or black, with more or
less crystal structure visible according as the rock is less or
more altered; pyroxenites or amphibolites, when but little altered,
are a mass of lustrous platey or fibrous dark crystals, while
serpentines are typically of dull aspect. The specific gravity is
high, ranging from as much as 3·1 in the less altered forms down to
about 2·6 in those which are more completely serpentinised.</p>

<p>The process of serpentinisation is of course a chemical change,
consisting largely in the combination of water with ferro-magnesian
silicates free from alumina; but it is remarkable how frequently
this chemical change has been accompanied by a parallel physical
deformation.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span>
Serpentines are almost always shattered rocks, full of slickensided
surfaces; when we compare the low sp. gr. of serpentine (2·6) with
that of augite, hornblende, or olivine (about 3·2), we naturally
conclude that the shattering of the rock is in all probability due
to the expansion on hydration causing internal stress, and the
slickensiding is due to the rock yielding along certain surfaces.
The cracking of felspars and the forcing of serpentine into them,
which are frequently seen in thin sections of olivine rocks, such
as the troctolite shown in <a href="#fig34">Fig. 34</a> on p. 304,
shows on a small scale the physical effect of expansion on
serpentinisation, and should lead us to expect a corresponding
effect in rock masses. It is thus not necessary to infer great
tectonic movements to explain the shattering of the rock, and in
fact the disposition of the serpentines in broad mountain tracts
like Gebel Gerf is opposed to the idea of there being here any
local accentuation of folding or crushing by general
crust-crumpling. I have calculated that a horizontal sheet of
pyroxenite of sp. gr. 3·1, ten kilometres wide, confined between
fixed abutments and prevented from increasing its thickness, would
rise into an arch having a height of about two and a quarter
kilometres at its centre if converted into serpentine of sp. gr.
2·6; this is, of course, not given as a precise example of what may
actually have taken place, but it will serve to show that expansion
on hydration may produce dynamical effects not inferior to those of
contraction of the earth’s crust, such as are believed to be the
main cause of mountain formation, and to explain why we may find
serpentines shattered to fragments and full of slickensided
surfaces in areas where the surrounding rocks show comparatively
little evidence of dynamo-metamorphism.</p>

<h4>Pyroxenites.</h4>

<p>Heavy dark green rocks, of medium to coarse grain, and
consisting almost entirely of a schillerized-looking mineral, form
the hill-masses of Gebels Um Ein and Qrein Salama, and similar
rocks are found in connexion with gabbro at Gebel Um Gunud and
elsewhere. From the diallagic appearance of these rocks in the hand
specimen, they were classed in the field as pyroxenites or diallage
rocks. But an examination of the slides cut from the specimens
reveals the main constituent to be hornblende, and the rocks must
therefore be placed in the division of amphibolites. It is,
however, highly probable that these rocks<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_316">[316]</span> were originally pyroxenites, the hornblende
having originated mainly from the alteration of augite; the change
from augite to hornblende in the gabbros has already (<a href=
"#Page_302" class="pginternal">p. 302</a>) been remarked, and in
these ultra-basic forms the same process appears to have gone
on.</p>

<p>Some parts of the great ultra-basic mass of Gebel Gerf consist
of bronzite-rock. Specimens from the least altered portions consist
almost entirely of bronzite, sometimes with a little olivine; the
rocks are, however, generally found passing into serpentine, such
as forms the main portion of the mountain, and on microscopic
examination even the freshest portions always exhibit more or less
serpentinisation. It will accordingly be preferable to treat of
these rocks under the heading of serpentines.</p>

<h4>Amphibolites.</h4>

<p>Rocks consisting almost entirely of hornblende occur in
considerable masses in the neighbourhood of Gebel Um Gunud, and
form the conspicuous hills Gebel Um Ein and Qrein Salama; they also
occur in a small patch about three kilometres east of Erf el Fahid.
In the field, especially with the coarser-grained varieties, there
is often considerable difficulty in identifying the main
constituent of the rock as hornblende, owing to the schillerized
appearance of the mineral being more suggestive of diallage; the
mass east of Erf el Fahid, for instance, was classed in the field
as a basic gabbro or diallage-rock, instead of a very basic diorite
or hornblende-rock, such as the microscopic examination proves it
to be. These rocks are always very heavy and extremely tough; they
weather commonly into great rusty-looking rounded blocks, and a
sledge hammer is required to get a specimen.</p>

<p class="cp3">Fig. 43.—Amphibolite, from hills near Gebel Um Gunud
[11,511], × 30. Almost the whole of the figure is occupied by
hornblende, which is seen clouded and altering to granular epidote
at <em>e</em>. Part of a large grain of calcite, bordered and
streaked with iron oxide, is seen at <em>c</em>, while <em>q</em>
is a small crystal of interstitial quartz. The slide also contains
a small proportion of plagioclase felspar, not shown in the
figure.</p>
</figure>
</div>
</div>

<p>The amphibolite of the hills about Gebel Um Gunud [11,511] is a
very hard and heavy coarse grained greenish-black rock composed
almost entirely of shining platey-looking crystals of hornblende,
which often reach two centimetres in length and breadth. The sp.
gr. is 3·08. The microscopic slide shows the rock to be granitic in
structure and to contain, in addition to hornblende, small amounts
of plagioclase, quartz, calcite, and iron oxides. The
irregular-shaped hornblende crystals show strong pleochroism, from
pale olive-brown to moderately deep green. The extinction angles
are large, being frequently over 20°. Twinning of the crystals is
fairly common. Many of the crystals<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_317">[317]</span> are clouded, and the alteration of the
mineral has resulted in the formation of much epidote. The
plagioclase is only present in very small quantity, strongly
clouded by decomposition, but still showing twinning clearly. The
quartz is clear, and is likewise present in very small proportion,
mostly interstitial. Calcite is fairly plentiful in large rounded
and irregular grains, rather turbid-looking, of a brownish or
greenish tinge, outlined and streaked with strong lines of iron
oxide, in a way which at times suggests that the calcite may
possibly be the result of alteration of a lime olivine.</p>

<p>A specimen of amphibolite [11,528] obtained from a hill near the
junction of Wadi Abu Marwa with Wadi Naait, about seven kilometres
north-east of Gebel Um Gunud, is a dark green rock of rather fine
grain, made up of shining plates and small fibrous crystals of
hornblende and chlorite. Its sp. gr. is 2·97. Under the microscope
the hornblende is in rather ragged-looking irregular crystals of
various sizes, all interlocked with each other, rarely showing any
approximation to idiomorphism except in the smaller crystals, which
are commonly limited by prismatic faces; these smaller crystals are
frequently included in the larger ones. The pleochroism is fairly
strong, <span class="gothic">a</span> pale olive brown,
<span class="gothic">c</span> moderately deep green. Prismatic
cleavage is well marked. Extinction angles are often large, ranging
up to 24°. A few of the crystals are slightly bent, and many show
more or less clouding owing to partial alteration to chlorite, but
on the whole the rock is fairly fresh. Except for a few specks of
magnetite, and the alteration product chlorite, the rock contains
nothing but hornblende.</p>

<p>The hornblende-rock or amphibolite of Gebel Um Ein [12,130] is
of medium grain, almost entirely made up of shining crystals of
hornblende with a little chloritic matter. The sp. gr. is 3·03.
The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[318]</span> microscopic
slide shows large individuals of hornblende inclining to
idiomorphism, set in a sort of ground mass of smaller crystals. The
hornblende shows the same strong pleochroism and high extinction
angles as in the two rocks just described; it is frequently clouded
and speckled with iron oxides, and often full of lighter-coloured
patches which extinguish with the rest of the crystal; in many
cases these lighter patches contain a central granule of iron
oxide, and they are doubtless due to a bleaching by segregation of
the iron. Between crossed nicols many of the crystals are full of
small fibres extinguishing differently from the rest of the
crystal; some of these fibres polarise in low colours and are
probably chlorite or serpentine, while others show brilliant tints
and are possibly actinolite.</p>

<p>The amphibolite which occurs three kilometres east of Gebel Erf
el Fahid [10,361] is of extremely coarse grain, looking like a very
basic gabbro owing to the schillerized appearance of its large
hornblende crystals and the presence of a little interstitial
felspar. The sp. gr. of the rock is 2·98. The section shows the
hornblende to be of a very pale green colour, with an almost entire
absence of iron oxide grains and other alteration products. Between
crossed nicols it has a fibrous woody appearance. The interstitial
plagioclase (probably labradorite) is likewise very fresh, showing
its repeated twinning very clearly; the crystals are full of tiny
fibres of hornblende, and are traversed by broad cracks filled with
a mosaic of smaller crystals of plagioclase and quartz.</p>

</div>

<p>The rock [12,157], of the hill called Qrein Salama, to the east
of Gebel Gerf, is interesting as containing olivine and bronzite in
addition to the more abundant hornblende, and thus forming a link
between the amphibolites proper and the peridotites; but as about
three-quarters of the rock is hornblende it is still classed as an
amphibolite. The sp. gr. is 3·05. In the slide, the hornblende is
seen in irregular crystals, colourless to very pale green, with a
fibrous structure which is strongly marked by patches of shading of
extremely fine black prismatic striations. With crossed nicols the
fibrous structure is still more apparent, the mineral polarising as
brilliant fibres separated by chloritic alteration products. The
pronounced striation and faint colour of the crystals are more
suggestive of diallage than of hornblende, but the extinction
angles measured in the slide are all less than 22°. Many of the
hornblende-crystals contain large numbers of small
rounded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[319]</span> grains and
strings of iron oxide. The olivine is mostly in rounded crystals,
frequently included in the hornblende; it is largely serpentinised
and full of small grains of opaque iron oxides, but kernels of the
original mineral remain. The bronzite, which is present in about
equal proportion with the olivine, is likewise extensively
serpentinised and full of iron oxide grains; it is distinguishable
from the olivine by a more fibrous appearance (the serpentinisation
having gone on mainly along the direction of the vertical axis
instead of along irregular cracks), and by its generally lower
polarisation colours in the unaltered portions.</p>

<h4>Peridotites.</h4>

<p>The peridotites, or felspar-free rocks consisting largely of
olivine, are usually classified into:—</p>

<p class="hang1-pad">(<em>a</em>) <em>Dunites</em>, consisting
entirely of olivine.</p>

<p class="hang1-pad">(<em>b</em>) <em>Harzburgites</em>, consisting
of olivine and enstatite or bronzite.</p>

<p class="hang1-pad">(<em>c</em>) <em>Wehrlites</em>, containing
olivine and diallage.</p>

<p class="hang1-pad">(<em>d</em>) <em>Lherzolites</em>, containing
olivine, diallage, enstatite or bronzite, and picotite or
chromite.</p>

<p class="hang1-pad">(<em>e</em>) <em>Hornblende-picrites</em>,
containing olivine and hornblende.</p>

<p class="hang1-pad">(<em>f</em>) <em>Mica-peridotites</em>,
containing olivine and biotite.</p>

<p>Most if not all of these classes are represented in
South-Eastern Egypt, but in the altered form of serpentine. The
change to serpentine has been so complete that it is now hardly
possible to extract even a small specimen of the primitive rock;
indeed, careful search is often required to obtain even specimens
containing any unaltered mineral whatever, and one has frequently
to rely on the structure of the serpentine for the identification
of the rocks from which it originated.</p>

<h4><span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_320">[320]</span>Serpentine.</h4>

<p>Serpentines cover about 400 square kilometres of South-Eastern
Egypt, forming the principal rock of several remarkable mountain
groups and also occurring in lower hill country.</p>

<p>The largest occurrence is that of the great mountain mass of
Gebel Gerf, where serpentine with alternations of gabbroid and
dioritic rocks can be followed from Bir Meneiga southward for some
thirty kilometres to beyond the Sherefa pass, while the breadth of
the tract from east to west is some fifteen kilometres or more at
its widest part; this tract includes a vast assemblage of high
peaks and ridges, towering up in many cases to more than a
kilometre above sea-level. To the north, south, and east, the
serpentine is bounded by gabbros and diorites, while on the west a
tract of schistose rocks separates it from another great serpentine
mass which forms Gebel Korabkansi.</p>

<p>Other remarkable serpentine masses are Gebel Abu Dahr and the
upper part of Gebel Sikait; serpentines also enter into the
composition of Gebels Ghadir and Um Tenedba, while lower hills
formed of similar rocks occur near Bir Murra in Wadi Shait, in Wadi
Um Khariga, near Gebel Kalalat, and on the plain east of Abraq
Springs.</p>

<p>The foxy red colour of exposed faces of serpentine hills, and
the generally shattered nature of the rock, have already been
referred to. When one approaches the masses closely, the red colour
often becomes less marked, because the fresh debris flanking the
hills is of a darker aspect. The slopes of serpentine hills are
usually steep, and this combined with the rotten nature of the rock
renders their climbing not always quite free from danger.</p>

<p>Any attempt to map out in the field the precise limits of the
different peridotites which were the parents of the serpentine ends
in failure, partly because the constituent minerals can generally
only be identified on microscopic examination, and partly because
the different peridotites pass gradually one into another, and are
evidently only produced by slight variations in the composition or
conditions of consolidation of a single magma. Even the limits of
the serpentine itself are not always very clear; for where the
associated rock is gabbro, as for instance to the north of Gebel
Gerf, there is a gradual passage through more or less serpentinised
olivine gabbro to the true serpentine. Golden yellow veinlets of
fibrous chrysotile can be seen running<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_321">[321]</span> through the rock at many places, and
occasionally veins and pockets of magnesite and an inferior kind of
asbestos occur (<em>see</em> <a href="#Page_330" class=
"pginternal">p. 330</a>).</p>

<p>The serpentines are nearly always more or less magnetic, and
sometimes show strong polarity. The compass was disturbed by 40° at
the triangulation station on Gebel Sikait; the amount of
disturbance changes greatly when one moves even a short distance,
and all estimations of direction from compass readings in
serpentine country are therefore liable to enormous error.</p>

<p>In a strictly petrographical sense it would be most systematic
to describe the serpentines in classes according to the nature of
the parent rock; grouping together, for instance, all those derived
from pyroxenites into one class, those from amphibolites into
another, those from dunites into a third, and so on. But besides
the fact that the nature of the parent rock cannot always be
determined with certainty, such a course would possess the
objection of separating the different parts of one and the same
mass; at Gebel Gerf, for example, we have serpentines derived from
rocks of various of these classes, though probably all formed part
of the same igneous intrusion and are thus genetically connected.
In the descriptions which follow, therefore, the serpentines of
each locality will be grouped together, irrespective of origin. The
localities are taken in order of latitude from north to south.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>A serpentine which occurs associated with amphibolite and
various schists about three kilometres east of Gebel Erf el Fahid
[10,360] may possibly have been derived from a mica-peridotite. In
the hand specimen it is a dark brown rock of dull aspect with
greenish patches, and shows marked magnetic polarity. The sp. gr.
is 2·63. The microscopic slide shows mainly colourless serpentine,
but there are strings and bundles of pale greenish-yellow chlorite,
and specks and strings of magnetite. The arrangement of the
magnetite (<em>see</em> <a href="#fig45">Fig. 45</a>) at once
attracts attention, being<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_322">[322]</span> frequently aggregated in parallel strings
reminding one of the cleavage of mica. Between crossed nicols the
chlorite is easily distinguished from the serpentine by its
slightly higher polarisation-colours (low yellows as compared with
greys); and its arrangement in long leaves and bundles, with
distinct traces of the original mica, leaves no doubt as to its
derivation from biotite. The parallel strings of magnetite are also
most likely due to alteration of biotite, for it is difficult to
account for their peculiar arrangement otherwise; they are mostly
separated by material of lower double refraction than the chlorite
above-mentioned, perhaps a variety of chlorite poorer in iron,
owing to the previous separation of the oxide. The clear serpentine
which forms the bulk of the slide does not contain much iron oxide,
and does not include any trace of the original mineral from which
it has been formed; but between crossed nicols it shows an
irregular mesh structure which makes one almost certain of its
derivation from olivine.</p>

<p>The serpentine of the hills on the west side of the Wadi Um
Khariga [10,368] is remarkable in the field by its foxy red colour
on all exposed surfaces. The rock, which has a sp. gr. of 2·63, is
nearly black on fractured surfaces, and no crystals can be detected
in it. The slide shows colourless to yellow serpentine, with a fair
amount of calcite often arranged along cracks, a liberal sprinkling
of magnetite, and one or two fairly large grains of picotite, or
chromite. In some parts of the slide the serpentine shows an
irregular mesh structure between crossed nicols; these portions, in
which the magnetite-granules show an irregular honeycomb-like
arrangement, are doubtless altered olivine. In other places the
serpentine polarises in clear greys with a fibrous aspect, and the
magnetite is arranged in parallel lines; calcite is typically
developed in these fibrous portions, sometimes along the cleavages
and sometimes in irregular patches. The fibrous-looking<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_323">[323]</span> serpentine probably represents
the alteration-products of both rhombic and monoclinic pyroxenes,
and the parent rock was thus a medium-grained lherzolite,
containing olivine, diallage, bronzite and picotite.</p>

<p>In the hills on the east side of the Wadi Um Khariga, about in
latitude 24° 55′, there is some serpentine which has apparently
resulted from the alteration of very basic dykes. The sp. gr. is
2·65. A slide cut from this rock [10,367] shows the same clear
fibrous-looking patches as the specimen last described, and
picotite, in a confused and nearly isotropic mass of fine fibres of
serpentine, with but little magnetite and no calcite. No original
mineral remains except the picotite. The clearer fibrous patches
may represent diallage or bronzite, while the rest of the
serpentine is somewhat doubtfully referred to olivine. There is
some trace of banding in the rock, perhaps due to movement during
consolidation.</p>

<p>A serpentine approaching an ophicalcite [10,376] forms the main
rock at Gebel Ghadir, where it is associated with a peculiar quartz
felsite resembling granulite. In the mass the rock, which has a sp.
gr. of 2·67, is black to green, veined with calcite; surfaces of
the debris are often covered with a brilliant green glaze. The
microscopic slide reveals an irregular mixture of nearly colourless
serpentine and cloudy-looking calcite, with abundant specks and a
few larger granules of slightly translucent deep-brown chromite or
picotite. Between crossed nicols, the serpentine is a mass of
fibres and little plates, in which a strong tendency to linear
arrangement can be seen, and here and there a lattice-structure.
Though none of the original mineral remains there is not much doubt
that the rock is an altered amphibolite or basic diorite; the
calcite is possibly derived from the alteration of an original lime
felspar, but it has been largely redistributed in the crushed rock
by solution and redeposition.</p>

<p>The serpentine forming the hills on the north side of the mouth
of Wadi Kalalat is a dark reddish-brown rock, of sp. gr. 2·76, in
which shining crystalline specks of olivine can be seen. It has
doubtless resulted from the alteration of a dunite, or rock
consisting almost entirely of olivine. The slide [11,510] shows the
rock still to contain abundant clear colourless kernels of the
original olivine, in a mesh-work of pale olive-brown serpentine.
The serpentinisation has taken place along irregular cracks in the
olivine, each crack being generally marked by a thin streak of
opaque iron oxide running longitudinally down<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_324">[324]</span> its centre, with serpentine fibres
running crosswise and filling the rest of the crack. Where the
kernels first left have themselves become changed to serpentine,
they are nearly isotropic, while the cracks polarise in clear
greys, so that even where the whole of a crystal has been
serpentinised the structure is still clear, both in ordinary light
by the magnetite strings, and in polarised light by the way in
which the serpentine of the cracks stands out from the more
isotropic patches within the meshes. There is a little accessory
diallage, easily recognisable by its fibrous appearance and the
oblique extinction of its unaltered portions. The diallage, like
the olivine, is passing into serpentine, but here the serpentine
goes on along cleavage planes as well as along irregular cross
cracks, giving the partially altered crystals a striped appearance
between crossed nicols. Where the diallage has become entirely
serpentinised, it can still be differentiated by its clearer
appearance from the olivine-serpentine in ordinary light, and by
its striated structure between crossed nicols; but of course unless
kernels of the original mineral are left one cannot be sure whether
it was diallage or bronzite. There are a few patches of calcite or
magnesite, and veinlets of the same secondary minerals; these may
have arisen from the alteration of a little original felspar, or
from the diallage.</p>

<p>Near the head of Wadi Arais, to the south of Gebel Um Bisilla,
there are some dykes of dark magnetic rock of sp. gr. 2·56. A
specimen from one of these dykes [11,519], turns out on microscopic
examination to be a schistose serpentine. It is traversed by
parallel strings of opaque and brown translucent iron oxides, and
granules of magnetite are also scattered over the interspaces. The
interspaces between the iron oxide strings are filled with
serpentine showing no recognisable structures, but containing here
and there little nests of clouded green hornblende, suggesting the
possibility of the rock being an altered basic diorite or
amphibolite.</p>

<p>The highly crushed and rotten serpentine which forms the high
and steep-sided mountain mass of Gebel Abu Dahr, differs
considerably in composition in different parts. The most typical
form of the rock, which has a sp. gr. of 2·77, is a dark brown
serpentine with little strings of olive-green matter, and
occasionally large dulled black crystals. A slide [11,516 A], cut
from this portion of the rock shows mostly olivine, altering to
serpentine in the usual manner with abundant clear kernels of the
original mineral. Associated with the olivine is another
mineral<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[325]</span> of a
somewhat fibrous aspect, altered partly to serpentine and partly to
another substance which polarises as a confused aggregate of fibres
and flakes in brilliant colours, the flakes extinguishing with
slight obliquity; the serpentine is formed mainly along the
vertical cleavages of the mineral (though it also fills transverse
irregular cracks), while the other substance (tremolite?) fills up
interspaces. In some parts of the mass the rock has a blacker
colour and a slightly higher density (2·87), somewhat resembling a
basalt with large greenish fibrous-looking crystals scattered
sparsely through it. The slide cut from this form of the rock
[11,516 B] shows no olivine whatever, practically the whole slide
being composed of the fibrous mineral just described, together with
a little nearly colourless fibrous hornblende, in which the change
above-mentioned appears to be going on. Thus it would seem likely
that the rock of Gebel Abu Dahr is essentially an altered
hornblende-picrite (or olivine-hornblende rock) with variations
towards dunite (olivine-rock) on the one hand, and towards an
amphibolite or hornblende-rock on the other. The alteration of
hornblende here is not a purely serpentinous one, but results in
the formation first of serpentine along cracks and cleavage planes,
and then of a tremolitic mineral in the interspaces. It is worth
remark, moreover, that in the slide free from olivine the change to
tremolite preponderates, and there is much less serpentine in the
altered hornblende than in the slide containing olivine; this
suggests that the presence of the neighbouring olivine has in some
way brought about more serpentine in the hornblende, perhaps by
actual forcing of serpentine from the expanding olivine into cracks
in the hornblende, or by the influence of pressure set up by the
same expansion.</p>

<p class="space-below1">In the serpentine from some low hills on
the plain a little to the east of Bir Abraq [11,506] we have a rock
evidently derived from a dunite, though not a trace of unaltered
olivine remains. The sp. gr. is 2·61. The microscopic slide
consists of nearly colourless serpentine with strings of magnetite
marking the cracks along which its formation began (<em>see</em>
<a href="#fig47">Fig. 47</a>). Between crossed nicols (<em>see</em>
<a href="#fig48">Fig. 48</a>) the main portion of the serpentine,
doubtless derived from olivine, presents a very remarkable
appearance; most of the polygonal spaces between the
magnetite-meshwork are lined with plates of clear serpentine, while
the centre is occupied by nearly isotropic material. Thus the slide
in polarised light presents somewhat the aspect of an aggregate
of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[326]</span> cells with dark
nuclei. Besides olivine, the slide shows a small amount of a
fibrous mineral, probably bronzite, which is likewise almost
entirely altered to serpentine, though a few original fibres
remain; the magnetite grains in the serpentine derived from this
mineral is typically aggregated in strings parallel to the
fibres.</p>

<p class="clear space-above1">A serpentine rock found associated
with fine-grained diorite at Gebel Um Tenedba [11,517 B] may have
been derived from an olivine diabase poor in felspar. The rocks in
this locality are highly altered and crushed, and frequently more
or less schistose. In a slide cut from the serpentine of the lower
part of the mountain, which has a sp. gr. of 2·71, all the original
minerals of the rock have been replaced by alteration products. The
main portion of the slide is probably altered augite; it consists
of serpentine with fairly distinct mesh structure in which iron
oxides are very abundant in clots and strings. Some patches, which
show a more uniform grey aspect under crossed nicols, are
doubtfully referred to altered felspar. Smaller areas, usually free
from iron oxide grains and mostly consisting of almost isotropic
serpentine with a substance polarising in low yellow tints running
along irregular cracks in all directions, are believed to represent
altered olivine; one of these areas is nearly filled with little
brushes of the substance just mentioned, giving it almost a
spherulitic appearance as the nicols are rotated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[327]</span>The predominant
rock of the mountain mass of Gebel Gerf [12,128] is a serpentine
apparently derived from a wehrlite or olivine-diallage rock. In the
hand specimen, it is a rather heavy black rock (sp. gr. 2·75) with
small pea-green spots and a few small bronzy and glassy looking
crystals here and there. The microscopic slide (<em>see</em>
<a href="#fig49">Fig. 49</a>) shows the olivine to be largely
altered to serpentine in the ordinary manner with separation of
magnetite, but some granules of the original mineral remain,
especially aggregated, together with augite granules, round the
diallage crystals. The diallage is tolerably fresh, and easily
recognisable by its fine striation and oblique extinction. Besides
the diallage, there is some ordinary augite, not always very easily
distinguishable from the unaltered olivine owing to its cleavage
not being very marked. Some of the diallage crystals show undulose
extinction as the result of strain.</p>

serpentine derived from bronzite-rock, Gebel Gerf [12,119], under a

bronzite; the serpentine is seen forming mainly along the cleavages
of the original mineral, with subsidiary cross-fibres.</p>
</figure>
</div>
</div>

<p>At many points the serpentine of Gebel Gerf contains a great
deal of bronzite, crystals of this mineral of typical aspect and
measuring up to five millimetres diameter being visible in the hand
specimen scattered liberally through the duller serpentine. The sp.
gr. of this portion of the mass is 2·81. The slide [12,119] shows
practically nothing but bronzite altering to serpentine, so that
locally the parent rock has been a pyroxenite rather than a
peridotite. The serpentinisation of the bronzite has proceeded
mainly along the fibres of the original mineral, but there are
numerous cross-fibres (<em>see</em> <a href="#fig50">Fig. 50</a>),
and here, as in the hornblende of the rock of Gebel Abu Dahr, the
change to serpentine appears to have been accompanied by the
production of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[328]</span>
tremolite. In another slide [12,127] the main constituent appears
to be still bronzite, but here it is of a pronounced olive-brown
colour even in thin section, and is accompanied by some nearly
colourless diallage; some of the olive-brown fibrous crystals show
extinction-angles of a few degrees, and it is possible that these
are hornblende.</p>

<p>Though the greater part of the Gerf serpentine has been derived
from rocks free, or practically free, from felspar, it is possible
that these were mixed with other rocks, such as gabbros and
diabases, in which basic plagioclase formed an essential
constituent. One of the specimens brought back from the mountain
[12,115], having a sp. gr. of 2·67, is a somewhat wedge-shaped
block, about ten centimetres square and four centimetres thick,
covered entirely with the shining black to greenish glaze which is
characteristic of shattered serpentine, except where chipped with
the hammer to test its coherence and to look for remains of
crystals in it. The fractured surface is mostly dull and nearly
black, with little strings and spots of greenish matter and
scattered shining specks. But although the block so thoroughly
resembles a serpentine, the slide cut from it proves the rock to be
a fine-grained diabase, consisting essentially of augite and
plagioclase, with a good deal of iron oxide. The plagioclase is
tolerably fresh, in lath-shaped forms still showing twinning very
clearly, while the augite is very clouded and is changing to
hornblende and chlorite or serpentine. In the field nothing was
noted which would separate this rock from the rest of the mass,
which it resembles almost perfectly in appearance, and whether the
diabase forms a dyke or sheet, or the specimen represents a
fragment of diabase caught up by the magma, is not certain. A dyke
of this material, shattered and serpentinised on all the fractured
surfaces, would be indistinguishable from the surrounding
serpentine. It is even possible, though not likely, that the
diabase is not a separate intrusion, but merely a variation of the
same plutonic mass which has given origin to the main bulk of the
serpentine.</p>

<p>Other variations in the serpentine which point to parts of the
Gerf mass having originally been of a gabbroid type, occur in the
mountains round Bir Korbiai and Bir Meneiga. A specimen from near
Bir Korbiai [12,125], is a greyish-black fine-grained rock full of
little white and greenish specks and strings, with pale
citron-green serpentinous matter covering the slickensided surfaces
of the fragments<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[329]</span>
into which the mass readily separates. The sp. gr. is 2·67. The
microscopic slide shows serpentine with pronounced knitted
structure in places, as though derived from augite, and
considerable patches of calcite which may represent an original
lime-felspar. The calcite has, however, been largely redistributed
along cracks, where it is often mixed with extremely coarse fibres
or plates of serpentine.</p>

<p>The specimen from the mountains round Bir Meneiga [12,104] is a
hard dull slatey-grey rock with black streaks and spots; it is
strongly magnetic and shows a tendency to schistose structure. The
sp. gr. is 2·54. On examination with a lens the grey matter has in
places something of a resemblance to saussuritised felspar. The
slide cut from this specimen contains no original minerals. The
bulk of it seems to be composed of very minute fibres or plates,
generally showing a distinctly parallel arrangement along the
planes of schistosity, but exhibiting knitted structure in places,
and thus probably consisting in part of kaolinic matter derived
from altered felspar, and in part of serpentinous matter derived
from alteration of augite; while scattered through the slide are
abundant patches and strings of calcite and magnetite. The rock is
too intensely crushed and altered for one to be certain of its
origin, but it appears to have been originally a diabase.</p>

<p>The serpentine of Gebel Korabkansi, to the west of Gebel Gerf,
is an altered olivine-bronzite rock (harzburgite) of moderately
coarse grain. A slide [12,140] cut from the least altered portion,
where the sp. gr. of the rock is 2·72, shows olivine to have been
the most abundant constituent; it is largely serpentinised in the
typical manner, but abundant kernels remain unaltered. Mixed with
the olivine crystals are others of a fibrous mineral, altered
partly to serpentine and partly to a confused mass of tremolite
fibres; in the few cases where any of the original material
remains, this fibrous mineral shows straight extinction, and is
probably bronzite. The alteration<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_330">[330]</span> of the pyroxene has here proceeded more
rapidly than that of the olivine. The pyroxenic mineral is easily
picked out in the slide by ordinary light, owing to the fact that
the olivine has altered to greenish-yellow serpentine, while the
mixed material produced from the pyroxene is of a dirty-white
aspect. Another slide from Gebel Korabkansi [12,112] exhibits in
places mesh-structure with clear kernels which extinguish very
obliquely to the meshes, showing augite or diallage also to have
been a constituent of the parent rock; and there is a single
ragged-looking crystal of dark green fibrous hornblende, altering
to nearly colourless serpentine. The sp. gr. of the specimen from
which this latter slide was cut is 2·63. Both the slides from Gebel
Korabkansi are rather poor in iron oxides, but there are a few
irregular crystals of chromite, generally enveloping olivine.</p>

<h4>Alteration Products of Serpentine. Magnesite and Asbestos.</h4>

<p>In many of the serpentine-masses the effects of solution and
pressure can be traced in the formation of veins and pockets of
magnesite, asbestos, and occasionally talc in the rock. Magnesite
veinlets are frequently seen, for instance, round about Bir Meneiga
[12,142] and Bir Muqur, while asbestos has been found in pieces of
several kilogrammes weight in the Wadi Sherefa el Sherqi [12,122]
and near Bir Muqur [12,153]. At the last-named locality it occurs
along the crush-planes of the serpentine, and appears to be
preceded by the formation of long fibres of a green
substance.<a id="FNanchor_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133" class=
"fnanchor">[133]</a> Where thickest, the glaze on the slickensided
surfaces of the serpentine fragments seems to consist of this same
green substance, which splits into hard fibres often reaching ten
centimetres or more in length and only a few millimetres in
diameter [12,153 A] and these hard fibres, which have a sp. gr. of
2·64, break up gradually, apparently under weathering influences,
into the much finer and more flexible fibres of white asbestos. The
quality of the asbestos is, however, inferior, for a specimen of
the softest kind sent to London for an expert opinion, was reported
to be of no commercial value; even had it been otherwise, the
quantity seen was too small to justify working, though of course a
thorough search among the mountains might reveal the presence of
bigger deposits than were encountered during the survey.</p>

<p class="sch">METAMORPHIC ROCKS.</p>

<hr class="decor spaced2 width4">

<p class="space-above2">Metamorphic rocks, comprising a great
variety of gneisses and schists, are widely and abundantly
distributed in South-Eastern Egypt, forming about half the entire
area treated of in this volume. The irregular way in which the
metamorphic rocks alternate with those of the igneous and
sedimentary groups will be better appreciated by a reference to the
geological map on <a href="#pl20">Plate XX</a> than by any verbal
description. As a whole, the metamorphic rocks represent the
remains of a complex of igneous and sedimentary deposits which were
laid down in remote geological periods; subsequently these deposits
were crushed, folded, and elevated into mountains, their original
structures being largely obliterated in the dynamical process; in
succeeding ages the metamorphosed complex was penetrated by the
great granitic and other intrusions which have been described in
the preceding chapter, and then planed down by denudation as an old
land surface before being wholly or in part submerged beneath the
waters of the Cretaceous sea in which the Nubian sandstone was
deposited. The elevation of the land after the Cretaceous period
was accompanied by further folding which must have increased the
degree of metamorphism of the rocks; but it is most probable that
the forces which produced these post-Cretaceous movements were of
less intensity and duration than those of more ancient periods, and
we may regard the metamorphic character of the older rocks as
having been for the most part impressed on them in Archæan, or at
latest in Palæozoic times. It is not impossible that some of the
more highly foliated gneisses may even have been parts of the
primitive crust of consolidation of the earth, while the clay
schists may be the remains of the very earliest sediments.</p>

<p>Besides the evidences of dynamo-metamorphism above-mentioned, we
find occasionally traces of contact-metamorphism, where igneous
dykes have locally altered the rocks into which they
have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[332]</span> intruded; but,
in general, the subsequent compression of the masses has
obliterated these traces, and the effects of contact-metamorphism
are negligible in comparison with those produced by dynamic
action.</p>

<h3><span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[333]</span>Gneisses.</h3>

<p>The most conspicuous occurrence of gneiss in South-Eastern Egypt
is the great mass which extends from Gebel Mudergeg and Gebel Migif
in the north, down the range of Gebel Hafafit, and along the
greater part of the Wadi Gemal. With this mass is closely connected
another stretch of gneiss to the south of Gebel Abu Khrug; the
hills which rise from the sandy plain round the head of Wadi Natash
are mostly gneiss, so that the gneiss is probably continuous across
the plain except where it is penetrated by the syenitic cones
called El Nahud. The total area covered by gneiss in this locality
alone is some two thousand square kilometres, and includes some
remarkable mountain masses, such as Gebels Migif and Hafafit.</p>

<p>Other gneissose areas of less extent occur round Bir Abu Beid
and to the south-west of Gebel Hamrat el Feg; while still smaller
areas are found in the hills to the north-west of Berenice, in the
remarkable triple-headed mountain called Gebel Um Rasein, and to
the north of Bir Um Bishtit.</p>

<p>Gneiss typically forms bold scenery of precipitous hills, the
colour of which varies with the composition of the rock, from pink
to grey. At Gebel Migif one ascends the mountain most easily by the
northern slopes, which are formed by the foliation-planes of the
rock, while to the south these are cut across by sheer precipices;
the same is the case at Gebel Um Rasein.</p>

<p>Of gneisses evidently produced by the deformation of granite, we
may take the rock of Gebel Um Rasein [12,108]<a id=
"FNanchor_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134" class=
"fnanchor">[134]</a> as a type. The bulk of the mountain is formed
of a nearly white acid rock, of sp. gr. 2·67, with dark spots,
resembling the granite of Gebel Elba in appearance, except that
here the dark minerals have a marked arrangement along definite
planes. (Compare the coloured figures of the two rocks on Plates
<a href="#pl22">XXII</a> and <a href="#pl25">XXV</a>). In places
the rock contains thin bands of almost pure biotite, and these are
often thrown into sharp contortions by the strong compression which
the mass has undergone. The strike of the foliation-planes in Gebel
Um Rasein itself is about south-south-east, with a dip of about 20°
to the east-north-east, but the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_334">[334]</span> strike swings round to about south at the
south end of the mass, and the inclination of the foliation-planes
become much steeper. The gneiss shows very marked pitting due to
weathering, the holes ranging from a few centimetres to a metre or
more in diameter and depth. A microscopic section of the rock shows
it to be essentially an acid hornblende-granite similar to that of
Gebel Elba, but crushed so that there is a “mortar” of broken up
quartz and felspar between the larger crystals, and the larger
where unbroken frequently show undulose extinction as the result of
strain.</p>

<p>In the Wadis Nugrus and Gemal there is a great deal of strongly
foliated grey gneiss [10,386-7], derived from the intense crushing
of diorites. A figure from a typical hand specimen of this gneiss,
looking at the edges of the foliation-planes, is given on <a href=
"#pl25">Plate XXV.</a> The sp. gr. of the rock is 2·88. The
microscopic slides show plagioclase and green hornblende in about
equal proportions, with some quartz and small amounts of biotite,
sphene, iron oxides, and apatite. The hornblende is very
fresh-looking, in strongly pleochroic (yellowish to deep
blue-green) straggling crystals, aggregated together along the
foliation-planes; the crystals, though variously oriented, show a
tendency to lie with their cleavages in the direction of foliation.
A very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[335]</span> striking
feature of the slides is the abundance of small grains of enclosed
felspar in the hornblende, giving the green crystals a perforated
appearance in ordinary light. The felspars, which are likewise
fairly fresh, are much smashed up, forming with the quartz a mosaic
between the irregular bands of hornblende; the grains often show
undulose extinction. Biotite, of a warm brown colour where not
bleached, is sparingly mixed with the hornblende. The sphene is in
small rounded grains, mixed with, and sometimes containing,
granules of ilmenite; the grains show a tendency to form little
aggregates, sometimes in the hornblende, and sometimes in the
felspathic portions of the slide. One or two stumpy grains of
apatite are enclosed in the felspars, but this mineral is extremely
scarce in the slides examined, and does not show its usual long
prismatic habit.</p>

<p class="main2">NATURAL SIZE.</p>
</div>

<p>As an example of gneisses in which the foliation is so intense
that all original structures have been obliterated by
recrystallization, we may take the red gneiss of the Abu Beid Hills
[10,659], of which a coloured natural size representation is given
on <a href="#pl25">Plate XXV.</a> In this rock, which has a sp. gr.
of 2·65, the main constituent is a pink felspar, mixed with a
little quartz and arranged in fine lenticles separated by greenish
laminæ which are doubtless altering biotite. This rock bears a
strong resemblance to the well-known red gneiss of the Erzgebirge,
which, from its chemical composition, is usually believed to be a
metamorphosed granite poor in mica.</p>

<p>Grey gneisses, equally intensely foliated with the Abu Beid
rock, occur in the range of Gebel Hafafit; these contain a much
larger proportion of biotite, and remind one of the grey gneisses
of the Freiberg district. But as no analyses have yet been made of
the Egyptian rocks, the absolute similarity to those of the
Erzgebirge is not quite certain.</p>

<h3>Quartzites and Quartz-schists.</h3>

<p>About ten kilometres south of Gebel Abu Gurdi is a tract of low
hills and ridges composed mainly of quartz-schists. The limits of
these rocks have not been mapped, but they appear to cover a
somewhat elliptical area with its long axis, measuring some eight
or ten kilometres, pointing east and west. Where first encountered,
at a point about twelve kilometres east of Gebel Selaia, on the
march from that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[336]</span>
hill towards the pass into the head of Wadi Lahami, the rocks
strongly resemble rather friable white to brown fine-grained
sandstones, with bedding planes dipping about 35° to the north. The
rock [10,413] consists almost entirely of white or slightly
iron-stained quartz grains, with, in places, scattered minute dull
black rods which are apparently hornblende. Traced further east,
the rocks have more and more the character of quartz schists, with
harder bands of quartzite, and the planes of separation, which
gradually become nearly horizontal, have more the appearance of
foliation-planes. The harder quartzite bands [10,414] are usually
brownish to greenish-white in colour, but sometimes take on a
purple tint, and show micaceous and chloritic scales on cleaved
surfaces; in some places the rock contains “eyes” of minette-like
composition. To the south the bedding or cleavage planes seem to
reverse their dip, this being now to the south as though there were
an anticlinical fold in the mass. There is considerable mixture of
other schists with the rocks, and dykes of diorite and pegmatite,
as well as veins of quartz, are frequent. A dioritic dyke which
cuts through the rocks at a point nine kilometres south-south-west
of Gebel Abu Gurdi, and which is itself crushed almost into a
hornblende-schist, has hardened and altered the quartzose rock on
either side of it into a close-grained horny looking rock [10,415]
apparently containing a great deal of finely granular
andalusite.</p>

<p>These quartz-schists may have arisen from the metamorphism
either of sandstones, in which case the parts to the west of the
tract are the least altered, or of fine-grained aplitic rocks, on
which view the sandstone-like aspect of the western portion of the
tract is due to weathering; the rock is certainly more highly
weathered where it most resembles an unaltered sandstone, and the
presence of hornblende and the “eyes” of micaceous matter are
suggestive of igneous rock. From a consideration of all the
evidence I was able to gather in a rapid march over the sea,
however, I incline to the view that the rocks are altered sandstone
older than the Nubian series, and probably of about the same age as
the ancient clays which gave rise to the clay-schists of Zabara and
elsewhere. The rocks are completely detached from the nearest
undoubted Nubian sandstone beds (which lie some forty kilometres to
the south-west, beyond Gebel Zergat Naam), and they are mixed with
schists and veined and altered to a degree which is nowhere
approached by beds known to be of the Nubian series.<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_337">[337]</span> Still, it is just possible
that the quartz-schists represent the remains of Nubian sandstone
strata, for the nearest beds of that series show-considerable
folding and faulting near Gebel Zergat Naam, and we should expect
still greater disturbance and alteration here near the main
watershed and close to a principal axis of mountain elevation.</p>

<p>A quartz-schist which is certainly derived from the metamorphism
of aplitic dykes or sheets, occurs as great inclined bands cutting
across the Wadi Shenshef close to some old ruins. The main rock of
the district, in which the bands occur, is a medium-grained
diorite. The quartz-schist is a greyish-white fissile rock, which
splits easily into great slabs; it has supplied an excellent
building material for the houses of the ruined town or encampment,
being used not only for the walls but also for lintels over doors
and windows.</p>

<h3>Clay-schists.</h3>

<p>Clay-schists cover extensive areas in the South-Eastern Desert.
They occur abundantly in the high hills to the east of Gebel Nugrus
and form a large portion of Gebel Zabara. They abound also to the
south of Wadi Antar about the longitude of Gebel Um Goraf, in the
hills on the east side of Gebel Abu Dahr, in the Wadi Hodein round
about where Wadi Um Tenedba joins it, in the hills flanking the
sandstone plateau of Gebels Dif and Anfeib, at Gebels Kolaiqo and
Eqrun, on the western flanks of the serpentine mass of Gebel
Meneiga, and in the low hills on the plain between Gebels Gerf and
Korabkansi.</p>

<p>Clay-schists are typically of a grey colour, though greenish,
purple, and reddish varieties occur. They are soft rocks, easily
scratched with a knife. In some places, as for instance at Gebel
Zabara, they are practically slates, cleaving into slabs often of
considerable size, while in other localities, as for instance near
Gebel Abu Dahr, they are crushed into matchwood-like splinters,
which can be used as slate-pencils. They are usually associated
with other metamorphic rocks such as crushed diorites and
hornblende and mica-schists. The direction of foliation of the
slaty and slabby forms is often persistent—at Gebel Zabara, for
instance, a general south-easterly dip of about 28° is maintained
over a considerable area; but there are<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_338">[338]</span> numerous local variations, and the number
of observations thus far made is too small for any general
conclusions to be drawn as to the regional distribution of dip. On
the whole, the clay-schists are remarkably free from knots or other
irregularities, though knotted varieties, doubtless the result of
contact alteration, have been observed on the south side of Wadi
Seiga and at a few other places.</p>

<p>The clay-schists have probably for the most part been produced
by the metamorphism of ancient argillaceous sediments; in some
places, as for instance in the Wadi Beida, a passage can be
observed into what appears to be a crushed conglomerate, while in
other places they pass into quartzites which doubtless represent
altered intercalated sandstones. The relation between the direction
of the foliation-planes and that of the original bedding is
unknown; it would appear likely that in most cases the traces of
bedding have been entirely obliterated by pressure. Nor have any
fossils been found in the rocks, though a sharp look-out was kept
in the more likely-looking localities, so that the age of the beds
is unknown. At present I am inclined to regard them as most likely
of Archæan age, antedating the great granitic intrusions; but
further evidence, either in the finding of fossils or from a more
careful study of the field relations of these rocks to the others,
is required before one can be certain that they are of so great an
antiquity.</p>

<h3>Hornblende-schists and Crushed Volcanic Rocks.</h3>

<p>Under the heading of hornblende-schists and crushed volcanic
rocks are classified a great variety of rocks, ranging in colour
from green to grey and almost black, in fissility from the finest
lamellation to almost massive forms in which the schistosity is
barely evident in the hand specimen, but all definable as
fine-grained dark-coloured schistose rocks consisting largely
either of hornblende or of its alteration products. Their origin is
not always clear, but many of them appear on microscopic
examination to be altered fine-grained syenites, diorites, and
lavas, and it is probable that practically the whole are altered
forms of various intermediate and basic igneous rocks. The reason
for including the hornblende-schists and crushed volcanic rocks in
one great group is the difficulty of separating the different
classes in the field. They pass one into the other, and many
rocks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[339]</span> which in the
field would be put down as hornblendic turn out on detailed
examination to contain little or none of that mineral, its place
being taken by decomposition products.</p>

<p>Schists of the types above defined occur probably more
abundantly than any other class of metamorphic rocks in the
South-Eastern Desert. They enter largely into the composition of
some of the main mountain masses, such as those of Gebels Abu
Hamamid and Abu Gurdi, besides covering great expanses of lower
hill country. In the mountain ranges they rise in steep-sided
ridges with knife edge summits, a good idea of which is given by
the photograph of Gebel Abu Hamamid on <a href="#pl07">Plate
VII.</a> In the lower hill country we have typically a dreary
confused looking waste of thousands of dark hills and ridges
separated by small winding wadis; sometimes there is a semblance of
system in the distribution of the hills, owing to the occurrence of
parallel dykes harder than the schists which they penetrate,
forming thus back-bones for long lines of schist-ridges.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Schist derived from Syenite.</span>—Among the
schists occurring near Gebel el Anbat, near the Wadi Hodein, is one
which appears to be a crushed and altered syenite. It is a speckled
grey and reddish-brown rock with a dull and rather granular
fracture, of sp. gr. 2·92. The slide [11,532 B] shows a rather
coarse granitic mixture of clouded felspar and heavily iron-stained
calcite. The felspar is considerably altered, showing no twinning,
but between crossed nicols it extinguishes in irregular bands and
is seen to be much crushed. The ferruginous and calcareous matter
is almost certainly altered hornblende; it forms irregular masses,
in which the iron oxide is mostly arranged in parallel lines as
though along the cleavage planes of the parent mineral, while a
clouded calcite fills up the spaces between the lines. It would
seem that in addition to pressure, carbonic acid has been the main
agent of metamorphism here, the ferro-magnesian<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_340">[340]</span> silicate being attacked and
its silica entirely removed, while the aluminous silicate of the
felspar has remained to some extent unchanged.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Schists derived from
Diorites.</span>—Hornblendic schists which appear to have been
produced by the metamorphism of fine-grained diorites occur largely
in the low hill country round the upper parts of the Wadi Muelih,
and in the mountain mass of Gebel Abu Gurdi. A specimen of the less
altered rock from the Wadi Muelih [10,357] is a fine-grained hard
grey basaltic-looking rock, of sp. gr. 3·04, in which the
schistosity in not very evident, though it is well seen in the
mass. The microscopic slide shows pale green hornblende in ragged
fibrous forms in a matted-looking clouded ground mass made up of
finely acicular green hornblende and plagioclase, with a little
quartz and orthoclase and a few grains of magnetite. Hornblende
fibres are often enclosed in the decomposing felspars, which rarely
show definite outlines and appear much shattered. The quartz is
probably of secondary formation, occurring as little patches of
mosaic.</p>

<p>The schist which forms the summit of Gebel Abu Gurdi [10,416] is
probably also a crushed and altered diorite; it is a rather
fine-grained hard greenish-grey rock, which with a lens can be seen
to be a mixture of greenish-white felspathic material and dark
hornblende; the felspar is mostly dull, while the hornblende, on
the other hand, is frequently in shining crystals. The sp. gr. of
the rock is 3·02. The microscopic slide shows the hornblende to be
of a very pale green colour, in large irregular crystals, often
including felspars. The felspar appears to be plagioclase; it is
typically in smaller crystals than the hornblende, with a strongly
marked tendency to idiomorphism, highly cracked and almost entirely
changed to kaolin. Some rather large straggling crystals of a dark
brown clouded and semi-opaque highly refracting<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_341">[341]</span> mineral, white by reflected
light, are perhaps altered sphene. Round the larger crystals is
more finely crystalline matter, much clouded, apparently composed
of altered felspar and hornblende.</p>

<p>The crushed dioritic dykes already mentioned as cutting the
quartz-schist to the south-west of Gebel Abu Gurdi are possibly
offshoots from the same magma which formed the main mass of the
mountain. Specimen [10,415], taken from one of these dykes, is a
fine-grained grey rock, of sp. gr. 2·93, with an even more decided
schistosity than that of the main mountain. The microscopic slide
shows clear hornblende of a green colour, strongly pleochroic
(greenish-yellow to blue-green) in irregular grains which are
frequently aggregated into nests and strings running in the
direction of foliation of the rock; the remaining material is a
mosaic of clear quartz, clouding kaolin, and sericite, presumably
representing altered felspar.</p>

volcanic rocks, summit of Gebel Abu Hamamid [10,397], × 30.</p>
</figure>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="bold">Schists formed by crushing of Volcanic
Rocks.</span>—Schists derived from the crushing of volcanic rocks
are very abundant in the mountains round Gebel Abu Hamamid and in
the Wadi Beida. Typical specimens from the summit of Gebel Abu
Hamamid [10,397] are hard green to grey rocks, of sp. gr. 2·7,
breaking with a rough dull fracture. With a lens, spots and strings
of dull white matter, with ill-defined outlines, are seen in a
green to nearly black ground mass. The microscopic slides show the
rock to be a breccia rather than a simple crushed rock, for in the
same slide very various structures can be seen. Some portions,
evidently andesitic, consist of perfectly idiomorphic lath-shaped
felspars scattered with a little decomposed hornblende in a glassy
brown ground mass. Others, more abundant, seem to be altered
quartz-diorite-porphyrite; in these parts, porphyritic quartz and
orthoclase crystals, in forms strongly inclined to idiomorphism,
clouded and strained, are scattered in a cryptocrystalline ground
mass containing a good deal of green chlorite and epidote. In other
parts of the slide, again, the chief porphyritic constituent is
formed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[342]</span> by large
green grains, which have evidently once been biotite or hornblende,
but which now consist of chlorite. In yet other parts of the rock
we have fragments of devitrified glassy lava. The different parts,
which are not always well outlined, are separated by schistose
bands composed mainly of strings of chlorite and epidote. Whether
the rock is a tuff, or a crushed conglomerate of igneous boulders
and pebbles, or due to complicated crushing of a series of
contiguous igneous rocks <em>in situ</em>, is not quite clear. In
some places, especially about the Wadi el Sheikh, the schists look
like crushed conglomerates, but these may possibly be rocks crushed
<em>in situ</em> rather than accumulations of rolled fragments
transported by streams.</p>

<p>The hornblende-schists which surround Gebel Zergat Naam are of a
peculiar type of which the origin is not evident, but are possibly
altered andesites. The typical rock [11,526] is a hard grey
basaltic one of sp. gr. 2·95, with a rusty-brown skin on exposed
surfaces. The microscopic slide shows little plates and brushes of
nearly colourless hornblende, liberally scattered in a clouded
ground mass consisting mainly of hornblende fibres in radiating and
dendritic groups, with a small amount of kaolinic matter and a few
grains of magnetite. The slide contains no distinct quartz, but
possibly a small amount of this mineral may be present in very
minute grains with the kaolinic matter.</p>

<p>To the metamorphism of andesitic lavas, too, are somewhat
doubtfully ascribed the grey and green schists of the Wadi Beida,
which have specific gravity of about 2·75. The slides from the grey
variety of the schists [12,116 and 12,159] show a very fine-grained
clouded rock, apparently a mosaic of quartz, kaolin, chlorite and
sericite, with larger scattered irregular plates of dark green
chlorite. In a pale green variety from the head of the wadi
[12,111], there is less chlorite and a considerable amount of
calcite.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Hornblende Schists of doubtful
origin.</span>—In the more highly foliated and harder varieties of
hornblende schist, which are typically of a darker colour than most
of those already described, we have rocks in which the process of
re-crystallization has been so complete that no trace of the
original rock remains. These rocks, which are true
hornblende-schists in the narrowest sense of the term, are less
abundant than the foregoing types, and generally occur as
comparatively narrow bands associated with gneisses and mica and
talc schists. All the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_343">[343]</span> minerals in them being of secondary origin,
they are usually in a quite fresh state, and fractured surfaces,
examined with a lens, exhibit a mass of glistening small crystals
of hornblende, quartz, and felspar. The density is usually about
2·9. Microscopic slides show elongated crystals of clear green
hornblende, strongly pleochroic (pale yellowish-green to deep
blue-green) arranged along the planes of schistosity, separated by
clear granules of quartz and a little felspar, with scattered
magnetite grains.</p>

<div class="box-float float-right">

quartz, from which it is distinguishable only in polarised
light.</p>
</figure>
</div>
</div>

<p>Near Gebel Eqrun are found hornblende-schists which exhibit a
curious banding in planes at right angles to the main foliation, in
the form of darker lenticular stripes a few millimetres wide and
about the same distance apart. A slide [12,117] cut from this
variety shows little trace of the banding, the lighter spaces
between the dark bands merely showing a clouding of the quartz and
felspar by tiny granules of epidote. The stripes are most probably
the consequence of a secondary compression in a direction
perpendicular to the original one rather than relics of a banded
structure in the parent rock.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Actinolite-schists.</span>—Very beautiful
bright green schists, in which the hornblende is in the fibrous to
silky form called actinolite, occur in small quantity associated
with mica and talc schists at Sikait [10,380] and elsewhere. In
these rocks the actinolite fibres, which often reach two
centimetres in length, are generally aggregated into bundles, with
radiating structure. In the microscopic slide the rock presents
even a more beautiful appearance than in the mass, the long fibres
of actinolite polarising in the most brilliant tints; associated
with the actinolite, there is nearly always more or less chlorite
and talc.</p>

<h3><span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[344]</span>Hornfels.</h3>

<p>Associated with the schists of Gebel Abu Hamamid and the
neighbouring mountains there are great masses of very hard
horny-looking rock [10,401] of green to grey colour, breaking with
a sub-conchoidal fracture, and of such close texture as to appear
homogeneous even with a strong lens. The pyramidal peak called
Gebel Um Semiuki, which rises to 1,282 metres above sea, three
kilometres to the north-east of Gebel Abu Hamamid, is almost
entirely composed of rocks of this type; in the mountain faces the
rock looks red, but this is only due to a film covering weathered
surfaces, the interior being of a green to grey colour. The rock,
which has a sp. gr. of 2·71, is frequently beautifully banded,
light and dark layers alternating with each other, and often
contains tiny cubes of pyrites [10,399]. The microscopic slide from
Gebel Um Semiuki shows a very fine-grained clouded compact rock,
apparently consisting of glassy matter with minute granules of
quartz and altered felspar, together with a little sericite, the
latter especially along certain bands. The slide from Gebel Abu
Hamamid is similar, but here the granules of quartz and felspar are
a little larger, though they are still too small to be seen with a
lens in the hand specimen; the appearance is that of a quartz
felsite on a small scale. It has already been mentioned (<a href=
"#Page_281" class="pginternal">p. 281</a>) that the quartz felsites
of Gebels Igli and Hadarba pass gradually into hornfels, and when
we remember that the schists of the Abu Hamamid district are mostly
crushed volcanic rocks, it becomes almost certain that the hornfels
associated with them is a crushed and devitrified glassy lava of
acid composition.</p>

<p>A yellowish horny rock with grey streaks [10,379], which occurs
near Gebel Sabahia, is conspicuous in the field owing to its
weathered surfaces being covered with a bright red ferruginous
skin, resembling cinnabar in colour. The sp. gr. is 2·52.
Examination with a lens shows the grey streaks to be filled with
myriads of brilliant yellow specks of pyrites. The microscopic
slide shows these to be aggregates of little cubes, while the bulk
of the rock is a schistose felsitic mass of quartz and felspar,
with scattered larger felspar crystals, much broken up and bent. In
this rock too we have therefore a rolled up and altered
felsite.</p>

<h3><span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_345">[345]</span>Mica-schists.</h3>

<p>Mica-schists, composed mainly of golden-brown lustrous laminæ of
biotite with more or less quartz, occur near the base of Gebel
Zabara and at Gebel Sikait [10,626], as well as in small quantity
at one or two other points. They are always associated with gneiss,
and appear to form irregular bands, alternating and mixed with talc
and other schists. The laminæ of mica can seldom be separated in
any large size, breaking up at a touch into small scales; they are
often highly contorted.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Emeralds</span> (Beryl).—At Zabara and Sikait
the mica-schists contain crystals of beryl (silicate of beryllium
and aluminium,
Be<sub>3</sub>Al<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>6</sub>O<sub>18</sub>), the
clear variety of which forms the gem emerald. The beryls are mostly
found in lenticular bands of quartz which occur in the mica-schist,
but sometimes they can be seen in the schist itself. The crystals
are mostly well developed hexagonal prisms of a pale emerald-green
colour, with characteristic vertical striation. The coloured figure
on <a href="#pl25">Plate XXV</a> will give a good idea of the usual
appearance of the mineral. In microscopic slides (<em>see</em>
<a href="#fig58">Fig. 58</a>) the beryls are conspicuous only by
their clear cut hexagonal outlines; they are quite colourless, with
low polarisation colours about the same as those of quartz. Both at
Zabara and Sikait there are numerous ruins and ancient mines where
emeralds have been sought; most of them are irregular shafts and
tunnels, twisting about as the old miners followed the varying
directions of the bands of schists. It is commonly believed that
gem emeralds were at one time extracted from these mines, and it
seems incredible that the mining should have been carried on to so
great an extent as is shown by the ruins and old workings, unless
stones of considerable value were obtained. The Zabara mines were
re-opened by Cailliaud in the time of Mohammad Ali
Pasha<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[346]</span> (1817), but
the stones extracted were of little value, being clouded and full
of flaws. A similar result followed a more recent (1904-5) vigorous
attempt by Mr. James, acting on behalf of Mr. Edwin Streeter, of
London, to work the emerald mines of Sikait; plenty of beryls were
found, but none clear enough to be of any great value, and the
enterprise was abandoned, Mr. James concluding that either the
ancient miners had worked out all the bands containing stones of
any value, or else, what is perhaps more likely, the ancients were
satisfied with a duller stone for a gem than our modern jewellers.
The dull forms of beryl are in our own day of very little value,
being principally used as a source for beryllium salts in chemical
laboratories.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Tourmaline.</span>—Besides beryls, the mica
and talc schists of Sikait contain in places abundance of black
tourmaline in well-developed crystals. At some spots this mineral
is so plentiful as to form practically small patches of
tourmaline-rock [10,395]. In thin section [9,874 and 9,908] the
tourmaline crystals, which are much clouded and irregularly
cracked, show beautiful pleochroism (colourless to deep orange),
and very high double refraction colours in prismatic sections. Like
the beryl, however, tourmaline is only of value as a gem when it is
clear and transparent, and all the crystals so far obtained are
dull and opaque.</p>

<p>Calcite, in rhomb-shaped crystals of a brown colour due to
presence of included iron oxides [10,382] likewise occurs in places
in the mica-schists of Sikait.</p>

<h3>Chlorite-schists.</h3>

<p>Though many of the decomposed hornblende-schists contain more or
less chlorite, I have only in two localities come across rocks
<em>in situ</em> which contain so large a proportion of this
mineral as to deserve the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_347">[347]</span> name of chlorite-schists. The first is in
the hills of Um el Huetat (latitude 25°), where typical
chlorite-schists are mixed with mica, talc, and hornblende schists.
The second locality is between Gebels Ras Shait and Nugrus, where
the rock [10,388] is remarkable not only in its peculiar appearance
but also by its strongly magnetic character. It is a thoroughly
schistose rock of a rather pale greyish-green colour and rather
silky appearance, with rusty looking spots. The sp. gr. is 2·77.
The microscopic slide shows the stone to consist essentially of an
aggregate of elongated plates and fibres of low double refraction,
which from the hand specimen seem to be chlorite, but in the slide
look more like antigorite. Magnetite grains are liberally scattered
through the chloritic mass. The rusty spots visible in the hand
specimen are translucent foxy red in the slide, in irregular broken
forms with well-marked cleavage and nearly straight extinction.
They are somewhat doubtfully regarded as deeply iron-stained
hornblende. Mixed with the foxy red material are aggregates of
granules of a highly refracting but isotropic mineral of deep
bottle-green colour (? spinel), and chloritic wisps. There are also
some clear colourless grains, resembling apatite in appearance
except that they sometimes show well-marked vertical cleavage and
high extinction angles; these are possibly a colourless augite, but
the double-refraction colours are far lower than is usual with this
mineral.</p>

<p>Typical chlorite-schists occur in the Wadi Salib Abiad, and near
Gebels Ribdab and Muqsim, in the extreme south-west portion of the
region. Hearing, from some wandering Arabs while at Gebel Abu Dahr
in February 1907, that prospectors were at work in the Wadi Salib
Abiad, I sent a guide to find out who they were and what they were
doing; the guide reported that on his arrival they had gone away,
but there were some old workings in a green rock of which he
brought a sample. I did not get an opportunity of visiting the
locality personally, but the specimen brought back by the guide
[11,523] is a beautiful apple-green chlorite-schist, with some
brownish calcareous-looking bands. The microscopic slide shows some
little quartz and talc besides the chlorite, and there are
scattered minute highly-refracting rounded grains of a feebly
translucent mineral of a reddish-brown colour, probably rutile. A
similar rock from the eastern side of Gebel Muqsim has been
reported by Mr. Charteris Stewart, who also records a normal
chlorite-schist as occurring on the north side of Gebel Ribdab.</p>

<h3><span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_348">[348]</span>Talc-schists.</h3>

<p>Talc-schists, though not widely distributed, are abundant in
certain localities. They form the main rock in many of the hills in
the district called Um el Huetat, to the west of Gebel Atut in
latitude 25°, where there are numerous old mines. In this district
there are immense masses of talc-schist of remarkable purity. The
rock [10,364] is of a grey to green or brown colour, distinctly
schistose, cleaving easily with a soapy feel, and easily scratched
by the finger nail; more massive forms occur which can be easily
carved into pipes, and these are frequently smoked by the Bedouin.
I descended one of the old shafts at Um el Huetat, and found no
evidence of other minerals having been worked than the talc itself.
A somewhat more earthy variety of talc-schist [10,396] was met with
near the Rod el Ligaia. Talc-schists also occur at Gebel Sikait
[10,383] and Gebel Zabara, where, as at Um el Huetat, they
alternate with mica and hornblende schists. But at Sikait and
Zabara the talc-schists are decidedly subordinate to the
mica-schist in which the beryls are found.</p>

<p>To the class of talc-schists is also probably best referred a
fissile and very rotten purple-brown schist, containing cubes of
limonite, which was found near the triangulation station on Gebel
Hamida, and again near the old mines of Romit. The microscopic
slide of the Romit specimen [12,139] shows the bulk of the rock to
consist of talc and chlorite, with blotchy stains and
floculent-looking masses of brown iron oxide and occasional clear
irregular granules of quartz. In this are plentifully embedded
perfect little cubes of limonite. The limonite cubes [12,129 and
12,136] weather out easily from the rotten matrix, and can be
gathered from the ground at the foot of the exposed surfaces.</p>

<h3>Calcareous Schists and Marble.</h3>

<p>Some very curious calcareous schists are found in Gebel el Anbat
and its neighbourhood, near the Wadi Hodein. In Gebel el Anbat
itself a mass of these rocks rises to a height of over 250 metres
above the wadi level. They are earthy-looking rocks of varying
colour, chiefly brown and reddish, often purplish on the rough
weathered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[349]</span> surfaces,
and sometimes have a talcose feel. A typical specimen [11,532 A]
has a sp. gr. of 2·92, and the slide cut from it shows it to be
almost entirely composed of grains of calcite, with here and there
larger irregular granules of quartz and of what looks like altered
felspar, and a liberal sprinkling of iron oxide. It is difficult to
assign an origin to this rock, but a variation of it [11,532 B] has
been already described (<a href="#Page_339" class="pginternal">p.
339</a>) as probably an altered syenite, and the main rock may
therefore represent the extreme form of alteration of an igneous
rock rich in lime felspars.</p>

<p>A hard close-grained reddish-brown rock of sp. gr. 2·91, with
dark streaks [12,107], which forms a high ridge, swathed in blown
sand, rising to 350 metres above sea-level near the Wadi Kreiga,
eleven and a half kilometres to the south-east of Gebel Beida,
resembles a quartzite in appearance, but turns out on careful
examination to be a calcareous schist. The microscopic section
shows a very fine-grained mosaic of calcite with a little quartz,
and scattered grains and strings of iron oxide. The origin of this
rock is uncertain; it may be a metamorphosed limestone.</p>

<p>The summit of a high hill rising to 686 metres above sea, on the
east side of the Wadi Um Khariga in latitude 24° 56′ 30″, is a
gozzany mass resembling the outcrop of a mineral vein traversing
the schists. On a fresh fracture, the interior of the rock [10,369]
is seen to consist mainly of dark crystalline calcite, with some
cubical crystals of pyrites, numerous rusty looking spots and
patches of limonite, and veinlets of white calcite. The microscopic
slide shows a mixture of calcite with kaolinic and serpentinous
matter, with a very pronounced schistose structure, containing
“eyes” of mixed calcite and iron oxides; the rock is therefore in
reality a ferruginous calcareous schist. The mass is too highly
metamorphosed for more than a guess as to its origin; but the slide
contains some granules resembling picotite and one or two small
patches of what looks like altering felspar, and the suggestion is
that the schist is a metamorphosed basic igneous vein.</p>

<p><span class="bold">White crystalline marble</span> has been
found only at one point, namely, about three kilometres south of
the jagged peak called Qash Amir, west of Gebel Elba, where it
forms a small patch in crystalline rocks.</p>

<h3><span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_350">[350]</span>Graphite-schists.</h3>

<p>A considerable mass of graphite-schist occurs associated with
diorite rocks near some ancient gold workings at Gebel Allawi. The
extent of the graphite-schist has not been mapped, but it occurs on
the north slope of the mountain, and as seen from the summit it
appears to run out westward for miles as a broad black band. The
rock [10,378], which has a sp. gr. of 2·70, consists of a mixture
of graphite with calcareous and earthy matter. The parts richest in
graphite are readily cut with a knife, and mark paper easily.
Analysis shows that the graphite, though sufficiently abundant to
appear in the hand specimen the dominant mineral of the rock, is
nevertheless present in surprisingly small proportion; a sample
tested by Mr. Pollard was found to contain only a trifle over one
per cent. of carbon.</p>

<p>A similar graphite-schist occurs associated with mica-schist in
one of the emerald mines of Gebel Sikait, and it may be remarked
that graphitic schists have also been observed by Dr. Hume near the
lodes in the gold mines of Baramia and Um Garaiart, both of which
localities, however, lie outside the limits of the area here
described.</p>

<p>The origin of the graphite-schists is uncertain. Perhaps the
hypothesis presenting the least difficulty is that which supposes
them to have been formed from ancient sedimentary rocks containing
the remains of plants; on this view the close association of
dioritic rocks suggests that the great of igneous intrusion may
have played a part in the distillation of the more volatile matters
of the plant remains, while the schistose structure shows that
pressure has also been active in the formation of the rock. But the
absence of any associated rocks which bear distinct signs of having
originally been ancient sediments makes one hesitate to refer the
graphite to an organic origin, and possibly the carbonaceous matter
may have been produced from quite another source than that of plant
life.</p>

<h3>Breccias.</h3>

<p>A very curious rock [10,385] which from a distance looks like a
giant diorite, occurs as a band in gneiss on the west side of the
lower part of Wadi Nugrus, is doubtless a fluidal breccia. It
contains ovoid masses of white aplite, sometimes measuring five
centimetres<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[351]</span> in
diameter, embedded in a dark fine-grained dioritic matrix with a
marked tendency to schistose structure. Most likely the rock has
been formed by the catching up of the fragments of a crushed aplite
in an intrusive diorite, and then the whole mass has been subjected
to the same pressure which foliated the surrounding gneisses.</p>

<p>More normal breccias are found at various points. One which
occurs between schists and hornfels near the summit of Gebel Abu
Hamamid [10,398] is made up of fragments of various altered
volcanic rocks, with large black flint-like lumps of hornfels, all
cemented into a very hard rock which breaks across the fragments
composing it. This breccia was doubtless formed by the same
movements which produced the schists of the summit of the mountain;
these latter (<em>see</em> <a href="#Page_341" class=
"pginternal">p. 341</a>) are themselves almost as much fine
breccias as schists.</p>

<p>To the west of Gebel Zergat Naam the stones in the wadis are
sometimes cemented into hard breccias by calcareous matter,
doubtless deposited by drainage waters which have dissolved out the
lime from felspathic rocks.</p>

<p>In the hill called Ti Keferiai, a little below the triangulation
point which marks the summit, a highly altered fine-grained
dioritic rock, containing much epidote, has been crushed into a
coarse breccia [12,123] cemented by rose-coloured quartz.</p>

<p>A remarkable green breccia is found in Gebel Hamata, where it
appears to form a large mass in the mountain-side to the east of
the main peak. This rock [10,407], which has a sp. gr. of 2·92, is
darker in colour and somewhat softer than the ornamental “breccia
verde antico” of the Wadi Hammamat district further north,<a id=
"FNanchor_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135" class=
"fnanchor">[135]</a> but it also is a very beautiful rock. In the
hand specimen, it consists of black angular fragments, up to two
centimetres in diameter, embedded in a dark green ground mass, the
whole of very fine grain and barely scratchable with a knife. Under
the microscope, the black fragments seem to be of basaltic nature,
while the green matrix is probably a highly crushed and brecciated
diorite-porphyrite; the whole of the slide is clouded by
decomposition products.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Fault-breccias</span>, produced by
differential movement of the two sides of faults, occur in the
neighbourhood of the Wadi Saalek, where the sandstones and schists
are much faulted (<em>see</em> <a href="#Page_359" class=
"pginternal">p. 359</a>). The<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_352">[352]</span> breccias here [11,539] are narrow bands
which stand up like dykes; they are very calcareous and highly
ferruginous, with occasional green stains, perhaps due to traces of
copper.</p>

<h3>Mineral Veins.</h3>

<p>Quartz veins deposited by solutions<a id=
"FNanchor_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136" class=
"fnanchor">[136]</a> in cracks and fissures of the igneous and
metamorphic rocks are very numerous and widely distributed,
especially in the Sukari district. They vary immensely in size,
from mere strings to veins two metres or more in thickness; they
cut the rocks in every direction and at every angle of dip. Steeply
inclined veins are by far the most numerous, but some have a flat
inclination and are then styled “reefs” by the miners.</p>

<p>The principal interest attaching to the quartz veins is the fact
that they frequently contain gold, though seldom in particles
visible to the unaided eye. The quartz veins were worked for their
gold by the ancients, the remains of whose dwellings and stone
grinding pans are found at numerous places, as for instance in the
Wadi Hangalia, at Kurdeman, near Gebel Sabahia, at Gebels Sukari
and Allawi, in the Wadi Lewewi, and at Romit and Darahib. Our
modern prospectors have found these ruins of ancient mining camps
and grinding pans to be the best guide to auriferous veins, gold
being seldom found except in and near the old workings. As
mentioned on <a href="#Page_27" class="pginternal">p. 27,</a> the
ancients worked the mines by convict labour, and they could for
that reason afford to work ores which are too poor to pay under
modern conditions. But in certain cases the veins have been found
rich enough to give possibilities of a commercial return to modern
mining enterprise; a list of the prospecting licences and mining
leases now in force is given on <a href="#Page_28" class=
"pginternal">p. 28.</a> As to the source of the gold, it is not
known whether it came up in solutions from below, or has been
secreted laterally from the country rock.</p>

<p>Besides gold, some of the quartz veins contain traces of copper,
but none of the occurrences of copper ore within the area specially
treated of in this book appear to be capable of yielding any
considerable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[353]</span>
quantity of the metal, most of them in fact being mere stains due
to oxidation and carbonatisation of traces of sulphides.<a id=
"FNanchor_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137" class=
"fnanchor">[137]</a></p>

<p>Calcite veins are much more rarely met with than those of
quartz. In only one of the veins I have examined is calcite present
in any considerable quantity, namely in the vein of the old gold
mines of Romit. In this vein, white to brown crystalline calcite is
found mixed with chalybite, limonite, and smoky quartz [12,105 and
12,141], the last-named only being apparently auriferous. There did
not appear to be enough chalybite and limonite in the vein to make
it worth following up for iron ore, especially in view of the
expense of transport from the place.</p>

<p>Magnesite and asbestos veins occur in the serpentines of the
Gebel Gerf district. These occurrences, which appear not to be
large enough to be worth working, have been described on <a href=
"#Page_330" class="pginternal">p. 330.</a></p>

<hr class="decor spaced2 width4">

<h3>Evidence of a former Pluvial Period.</h3>

<p>Given a sufficiently long period for their activity, the
denuding and transporting agencies at work at the present day are
capable of accounting for most of the superficial sculpturing of
South-Eastern Egypt. The country is not absolutely rainless, and
within a decade most of the dry valleys have been for a few hours
the beds of streams, the result of rain storms. There is
practically no frost in this part of the world, so that
disintegration by the freezing of water in crevices of the rock
does not occur on any large scale; the diurnal variations of
temperature, are, however, so great that this cause alone is very
potent in breaking up rock material. The disintegrated matter
accumulates as heaps of debris and sand, ready to be transported
towards the Nile or the sea by the streams which follow the next
rainfall. Both in erosion and in the transport of sand, wind is a
very active agent, and accounts for the formation and distribution
of immense quantities of sand. Thus the mountains are slowly being
lowered, and the rocky valleys between them are being widened and
deepened, even at the present day, and the accumulations of sand on
the coast-plain and elsewhere are being slowly increased in
thickness.</p>

<p>But when we look at the great wadis, often hundreds of
kilometres in length, cut to a depth of fifty metres with a width
of half a kilometre through the sandstone plateaux which separate
the mountain ranges from the Nile, it is difficult to conceive that
rainfall and denudation have not in the past been greater than at
present. In our own day, it is but seldom that the great wadis
convey streams as far as the Nile or the sea, their waters being
usually absorbed by the sandy bed before the end is reached;
erosion nowadays is practically confined to the upper reaches of
the wadis, and unless we postulate greater rainfall in the past,
inconceivable ages must have been occupied in<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_355">[355]</span> the erosion of these great channels. We
are thus driven to believe that what is now a very dry area was
formerly one of considerable rainfall. This belief is supported by
the traces of glaciation in Europe, for it is natural to infer that
when temperate Europe had an arctic climate, northern Africa had a
temperate one; the effect, whatever its cause, being practically
equivalent to an increase of latitude. This change of climate is
equally evidenced by geological observation in other parts of
Egypt. It is even likely that the climate of Egypt may be slowly
changing at present; but the change within the historical period
has been so small as to be practically negligible.</p>

<h3>Origin of the Red Sea.</h3>

<p>If the 200-metre contour of the bottom of the Red Sea, shown on
<a href="#pl01">Plate I,</a> be examined, it will be found to
exhibit great indentations towards the great mountain masses, while
there is a curious projection including the Island of Zeberged
which mimics the present Ras Benas. Some of the indentations of the
contour line lie in the direct prolongation of existing great
wadis, such as those of Lahami, Khoda, Hodein, Di-ib, and Serimtai.
The obvious suggestion from this coincidence is that the sea has
encroached on the land since the drainage-system had substantially
its present form, and we infer a sinking of the region at no very
remote geological epoch. The central parts of the Red Sea attain
depths of over 2,000 metres; thus this sea was a great and deep one
even when the level of its waters, relative to the land, was 200
metres lower than now. We have no information which would give us a
clue to the origin of this primitive sea, but the inference from
the contours is that the <em>present</em> extent of the Red Sea has
been caused by a great general subsidence of the land, and not by
trough-faulting as has hitherto been usually stated.<a id=
"FNanchor_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138" class=
"fnanchor">[138]</a></p>

<p>The subsidence just referred to was even greater than would be
gathered from a consideration of the present coast-line. At
intervals along the entire eastern coast of Egypt are hills of
gypsum; these are never found except close to the present
sea-borders, and the natural deduction is that the gypsum beds were
deposited when the sea was at a higher level than at present. At
Ras Benas, the gypseous strata<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_356">[356]</span> reach altitudes of nearly 200 metres, so
that at the time when the gypsum was formed the Red Sea must have
covered a much greater area than now, extending in fact
approximately to the contour of 200 metres above present sea-level.
As to the epoch when this greater extent of the sea existed, we
should have a clue if we knew the age of the gypsum beds, which
unfortunately is not the case; but they are almost certainly
younger Tertiary beds, possibly Miocene or even Pliocene, so that
in any case the Red Sea is a depression of considerable
antiquity.</p>

<h3>Possible Former Extent of the Eocene Rocks.</h3>

<p>Eocene rocks are entirely absent from the district, and the same
is the case with Cretaceous rocks younger than the Nubian
sandstone. But if we go westward along the parallel of Berenice,
across the Nile into longitude 23° 30′, we come to the plateau face
of Gebel Garra, where there are exposed thicknesses of about ninety
metres of Eocene limestone and 240 metres of Cretaceous marls.
These beds cover great expanses further west and north; they
evidently once extended beyond their present limits, and we may ask
whether they ever reached over the Red Sea mountains here, as is
the case in North-Eastern Egypt. To this question no answer can be
given; from Berenice to Gebel Garra is a distance of over 300
kilometres, and even a very gradual thinning of the beds eastward
would account for their absence from the main mountains; at the
same time the denudation which has removed every trace of the hard
Eocene limestone from the plain between Gebel Garra and the Nile
may well have done the same further east.</p>

<h3>Original Extent of the Nubian Sandstone.</h3>

<p>The Nubian sandstone is found on both sides of the watershed
ranges, and the question raised by its distribution is in regard to
its possible original continuity. Did the Nubian sandstone once
extend over the present igneous mountains, or was it laid down on
either side of a great island ridge? In other words, did the Red
Sea mountains exist as such in Cretaceous times, or have they been
subsequently elevated, and the Nubian sandstones which covered them
denuded away? To this question it may be stated at once that no
certain answer can be given; but a good deal of study has been
devoted to the facts bearing upon it, and these facts will be
briefly enumerated and discussed below.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[357]</span><em>Evidence
from Volcanic Intrusions.</em>—That the Nubian sandstone is younger
than the igneous rocks in general is proved by the almost complete
absence of intrusions into the sandstone. Apart from an interbedded
diabase sheet in the north part of the region and a small basic
dyke near Gebel Awamtib, the igneous rocks appear nowhere to
penetrate the Nubian beds. The sandstone is <em>a fortiori</em>
younger than the metamorphic rocks into which the igneous masses
have been intruded.</p>

<p><em>Evidence from Present Distribution.</em>—Coming now to the
distribution of the sandstone, though we find it on both sides of
the main ranges, there is not a trace of sandstone among the higher
mountains; this of course proves nothing, for denudation would be
most active among the peaks and in districts of maximum up-thrust,
and sandstone is an easily erodible rock. The long tongue of
sandstone plateau which terminates in Gebel Anfeib extends indeed
right across the main watershed, but a reference to the
orographical map (<a href="#pl01">Plate I</a>) will show that this
extension is along a north-west to south-east general depression,
where the Wadis Hodein and Garara form a cut across the map
separating the main mountain masses into north and south groups.
The presence of the sandstone tongue here would be equally well
accounted for whether the mountains were elevated before or after
the deposition of the Nubian beds.</p>

<p>Not only is the sandstone absent from the main mountains, but it
is never found in such close proximity to them as to render a
decisive answer to our question. Thus the eastern scarp of the
sandstone plateau in the north part of the area overlooks a broad
tract of low country between it and the mountains; and similarly
from Gebel Anfeib one overlooks low country to the north, east, and
south. On the eastern side of the mountains the sandstone deposits
are restricted to small patches considerably removed from the main
summits, and even in most cases from their foot-hills.</p>

<p><em>Evidences from Structural Features.</em>—With regard to the
structural evidences to be gathered from the sandstone itself, it
was hoped that the observations of the dip of the beds at different
places would throw light on the question as to whether their
deposition antedated the mountain formation or no.</p>

<p>To the north of latitude 24°, the eastern edge of the sandstone
scarp showed beds differing but little from the horizontal, though
very gentle folding in various directions is probable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[358]</span>Further south,
near Gebel Zergat Naam, much more decided evidences of folding, and
even of dislocation, were met with. The head of the Wadi el Kreim,
south-west of Zergat Naam (<em>see</em> the geological map on
<a href="#pl20">Plate XX</a>) is probably a line of fault, for here
on the south-west of the wadi we have sandstones coming right down
to the wadi floor, with a dip of 30° to the south-west near the
edge, becoming flatter the further we go from the wadi, while on
the other side are crushed and brecciated schists. Going further
west, in the sandstone hill-mass which lies twelve kilometres west
of Zergat Naam, the dip of the beds is in the opposite direction,
being 10° to 15° north-east, and granite appears at the foot of the
steep west-south-west slope; this, with the preceding observation,
seems to indicate a synclinal fold terminated near Zergat Naam by a
fault up-thrusting the schists and syenite.</p>

<p>Where the Wadi Garara cuts through the sandstone hills to
receive the Wadi el Kreim, the beds dip markedly to the south, the
observed inclinations being 60° or more at the north edges, rapidly
falling to 20° or less further south; the north faces show granite
and schists at their base.</p>

<p>Further west, on the way to Gebel Um Harba, the sandstone of the
hills showed dips to the east of 15°. At Gebel Um Harba itself
there are thick beds of sandstone dipping 13° east-north-east,
while all around the mountain one looks out over beds having
approximately the same inclination.</p>

<p>At Gebel Um Khafur, the dip is 13° to 14° to the
north-north-east, and is very constant over a large area. From the
north side, where the plain is 380 metres above sea-level, the
hills rise with a succession of dip slopes and basset-edges over a
horizontal distance of 2·9 kilometres (measured perpendicular to
the strike) to the triangulation beacon at 560 metres above sea,
the beds all along dipping at 13° or 14°. Unless there is
step-faulting here along the strike-wadis<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_359">[359]</span> (<em>see</em> <a href="#fig60">Fig. 60</a>)
the total thickness of Nubian sandstone here is over 450 metres.
This is a much greater thickness than has been noted anywhere else
in Egypt, and I am inclined to think that there is step-faulting
along at least two of the strike wadis which separate the hill-mass
into ridges.</p>

<p>In approaching Gebel Awamtib from the north-west, I crossed over
a small patch of diorite in the sandstone at the pass from Wadi Um
Terbi into Wadi Awamtib, and a basic dyke was found cutting the
sandstone of a spur of Gebel Awamtib. The beds of Awamtib itself
dip pretty uniformly a little north of west.</p>

<p>About nine kilometres to the south of Gebel Awamtib, a station
was taken on a sandstone headland with schists and quartz veins at
its floor, and afterwards I skirted the limit between sandstone and
granitic rocks on the way to Gebel Um Reit. All along this route
there was no suggestion of sharp folding or faulting; the beds were
nearly horizontal right up to the limit, where the granite hills
rise suddenly (<em>see</em> <a href="#fig61">Fig. 61</a>).</p>

<p>From the top of Gebel Um Reit, which itself is granite, the
sandstone limit could be seen to the north and east; the beds dip
30° in places; in those on the east the direction of dip is about
south. The region round Um Reit is evidently one of considerable
disturbance, but the sandstone is too far off for one to get any
precise idea of its nature from the summit.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">[360]</span>Going northwards
from Um Reit across the Wadi Saalek and up one of its branches into
the head of Wadi Muegil, there is a good exposure of faulted
sandstone overlying schists just before reaching the pass. Here
(<em>see</em> <a href="#fig62">Fig. 62</a>) one of the faults is a
distinct overthrust, with a north-easterly strike, and there are
other faults in a parallel direction.</p>

<p>From the Wadi Muegil northwards past the Galt el Aguz to Gebel
Um Harba there are gentle dips and curvings of the sandstone beds,
with a predominant dip about north-east. At the Galt el Aguz the
sandstone rocks are much tumbled about, but this appears to be due
to fall of over-hanging beds.</p>

<p>At the pass from Wadi Um Arta into the head of Wadi Silsila, the
dip of the sandstone is north-north-east. In its lower part, Wadi
Silsila passes between sandstone ridges the dip of which is
constantly east-north-east.</p>

<p>Round Bir Abraq and the triangulation station on Gebel Abraq
(<em>see</em> large scale map on <a href="#pl15">Plate XV</a>) the
main direction of dip is east-south-east; the pool of Bir Abraq
itself is under projecting slabs of sandstone dipping in this
direction. Bir el Sunta, a little further north, appears to lie in
a syncline, the beds of the hills to the north dipping south-east,
while those to the south dip north-west.</p>

<p>Approaching the sandstone from the east by Wadi Hodein, one
traverses granite country with felsite dykes and enters suddenly
into high sandstone plateaux. The beds at the Abu Saafa Springs dip
about 5° northwards.</p>

<p>The beds of Gebel Dif and Gebel Anfeib have a prevalent dip on
the west side to the east and north-east, while on the east face
the dip appears to be in the reverse direction. This great mass of
sandstone plateau may thus be a syncline with a north-westerly
strike (<em>i.e.</em>, a strike roughly parallel to the main
direction of the watershed mountain ranges), but the eastern face
was not examined in detail, and it may be that the whole mass dips
to the north-east; some outlying small sandstone masses near the
head of Wadi Edunqul show no reversal, the dip being still
east-north-east. At Bir Dif the sandstones are variously tilted,
and probably faulted.</p>

<p>The sandstones on the east side of the watershed ranges, near
Gebel Ranga, were observed by Dr. Hume to dip towards the sea. In
the south part of the region there are some low hills forming two
series of ridges between the sea and Gebel Kolaiqo, separated by
hills of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">[361]</span> red
aplitic granite; these hills were not actually visited, but were
mapped from some little distance, and the dip of the beds was not
measured, but the nature of the rocks was confirmed by specimens of
sandstone brought back by guides sent to the place.</p>

<p>Summing up the dips and disturbances of the sandstone beds at
the different places, it is clear that the strata are the more
disturbed, the more closely they approach the main mountain ranges;
this and the seaward dip of the beds near El Ranga are so far in
favour of the view that the sandstone may once have extended right
over the present mountains. But it will be seen that the
disturbances of bedding are of an irregular character, especially
between Gebels Zergat Naam and Um Reit, where the folding and
faulting are often in directions quite distinct from that of the
main mountain axes, and it may be that these disturbances are due
to later movements rather than to the elevation of the main
mountain ranges. So far as observations on the sandstone itself go,
therefore, the question as to whether the Nubian sandstones of the
Red Sea border ever directly joined those on the west of the
mountains remains open; the observed disturbances of the beds give
us clear proof that considerable earth movements have taken place
since the sandstone was deposited, but they are inconclusive as to
whether these same movements caused the elevation of the great
mountain ranges.</p>

<h3>The Igneous and Metamorphic Rocks.</h3>

<p>Turning now to the main mountain-forming rocks, we find them
composed of the two great classes, igneous and metamorphic. Though
in places we have transition members, such as granites passing into
gneiss, yet on the whole the two groups are quite distinct, and we
find typical igneous masses rising in the midst of equally typical
schists. Under these circumstances there can be no hesitation in
considering the two groups to be of different ages, and that the
igneous rocks must be the younger.</p>

<p>The igneous masses are divisible geologically into the three
classes of (<em>a</em>) lavas, (<em>b</em>) dykes, and (<em>c</em>)
plutonic rocks.</p>

<p><em>Lavas.</em>—Amongst the igneous rocks, the lavas are those
most poorly represented. Apart from the andesite of Gebel Sufra,
and the diabase sheets in or under the Nubian sandstone, there are
only a few<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">[362]</span>
occurrences of volcanic rocks in all the area, a circumstance which
is easily explained by the enormous denudation which has gone on
and the fact that lavas, being superficial out-pourings, will have
been most exposed to denuding forces.</p>

<p><em>Dykes.</em>—Dykes seam the schists and igneous rocks,
frequently in such numbers and with such parallelism as to give to
the land the form of a succession of ridges separated by long
narrow depressions, forming “dyke country.” In nature, the dykes
vary from extremely acid rocks like aplites and quartz-felsites, to
very basic forms such as diabase and basalt. There is on the whole
a preponderance of basic over acid types. As already remarked, only
one instance of a dyke cutting the Nubian sandstone has been
observed in the district. Another significant feature in the
distribution of dykes is that while dykes of all kinds are found
cutting schists and acid plutonic igneous rocks, the basic plutonic
masses are as a rule free from dykes; this suggests that the basic
plutonic rocks may be on the whole younger than the acid forms.</p>

<p><em>Plutonic Rocks.</em>—The plutonic rocks include granites,
syenites, diorites, gabbros, pyroxenites, amphibolites, and
peridotites. But these are not all of equal importance, and a
natural division from the field observations is a two-fold one into
acid and basic groups, which are tolerably well marked off from
each other and are most likely of different ages. The acid class on
this view consists of the granites and syenites, while the basic
class contains all the other rocks above-mentioned. The granites
are on the whole of a very acid type; syenite is very scarce and
nearly always occurs in close association with granite. Of the
basic group, probably the most abundant and most typical rock is
gabbro; diorites and the various ultra-basic rocks are almost
always closely associated with gabbro. Where acid and basic rocks
occur in proximity (as for instance near Bir Abraq, where an acid
granite occurs side by side with a serpentine) there is a sharp
change, without transitional forms.</p>

<p>The much greater abundance of dykes in the plutonic rocks of the
acid group as compared with those of basic composition, as
mentioned above, inclines us to regard the basic group as the
younger—a view which is further supported by the greater frequency
with which a tendency to gneissose structure is noticeable in the
acid rocks. The fact that the basic members are frequently in a
higher state of decomposition<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_363">[363]</span> than the acid ones is not contrary to this
view, being due to the greater ease with which their constituents
undergo weathering; and as explained on <a href="#Page_315" class=
"pginternal">p. 315,</a> the fissured state of the altered
peridotes is probably not due to the same earth forces which have
sheared the granites, but to internal stresses set up by the
expansion of the rocks on serpentinisation.</p>

<p>Though we may be fairly sure that the basic plutonic rocks are
on the whole younger than the acid ones, we have no certain guide
from which to estimate the geological age of either. We know from
their relations to the sandstone that they are both older than the
Upper Cretaceous, but we cannot say how much older; they may be
anything from Archæan to Jurassic; the circumstance that similar
rocks underlie Carboniferous strata in Sinai inclines us to place
them at least as far back as Palæozoic times.</p>

<p><em>Gneisses and Schists.</em>—The gneisses and schists which
cover so much of the country are obviously older than the plutonic
masses which are intruded in them, and for these metamorphic masses
we need have small hesitation in speculating on an Archæan age.
They exhibit a wonderful variety of composition. Most of the
gneisses are doubtless sheared ancient igneous rocks, such as
granite and diorite, and a similar origin may be assigned to many
of the schists. Other rocks, as for instance the clay-schists,
graphite-schists, and marble, have almost certainly originated from
the metamorphism of ancient sedimentary rocks. But in a large
number of cases we have at present no clue to the parent rock from
which the schists have been formed.</p>

<h3>Summary of Geological History of South-Eastern Egypt.</h3>

<p>Having in the foregoing pages discussed the evidences for the
relative ages of the different classes of rocks and their mutual
relations, we may now endeavour to reconstruct the past geological
history of this part of Egypt from the information gathered. In
this process we shall reverse the order of consideration taken
above, and begin with the oldest rocks.</p>

<p>The schists and gneisses probably represent, not the original
crust of consolidation of the earth, but a complex of ancient
sedimentary and igneous rocks, laid down in pre-Palæozoic times and
subsequently crushed, folded, and faulted into mountains which were
subsequently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">[364]</span>
denuded and worn down. In parts of the main mountain-masses we may
possibly still have the cores of some of these ancient elevations,
but most of the present mountain peaks are formed of a later series
of igneous rocks.</p>

<p>The first igneous intrusions into the schists and gneisses were
the granites which form such peaks as Gebels Nugrus, Faraid, and
Elba. Then followed crushing and folding of these rocks, giving
them often a gneissose structure and opening fissures, up which
came later intrusions, mostly of basic rocks, in the form of dykes.
With the dykes or later came great basic intrusions of gabbroid
rocks, forming such masses as Gebels Dahanib, Gerf, and Meisah.</p>

<p>A long interval now followed of which the rocks contain no
record. We do not know whether the area was submerged or not in
Palæozoic and early Mesozoic times; but if it was, all trace of the
deposits of these ages has vanished in the great denudation which
surely took place before the Upper Cretaceous sea swept over the
country and deposited the Nubian sandstone. We do not know whether
the Red Sea mountains then stood up as islands, or whether they
were subsequently elevated. Nor do we know whether the area
remained wholly or partly submerged during the Eocene period. But
we are sure that at some time between the Upper Cretaceous and
Oligocene epochs there was a great elevation of the land, with
folding and faulting, especially in the areas now occupied by the
great mountain masses, and possibly the mountains had their origin
in this movement of elevation. The Red Sea depression may well have
originated in a complementary sinking at this same period. The
depth of the sea is of the same order (2,000 metres) as the height
of the mountains on the adjacent land.</p>

<p>In the succeeding Oligocene period the land was being sculptured
into something like its present form, and probably the main
drainage lines of to-day were then formed.</p>

<p>About the Miocene epoch there was a sinking of the crust in this
region. The Red Sea increased in area, and then, probably as the
results of evaporation in a closed sea, deposits of gypsum were
laid down. A subsequent elevation in Pliocene or post-Pliocene
times raised these deposits along the present shores.</p>

<p>In geologically recent times a further gentle elevation has gone
on, giving rise to slightly raised coral-reefs and sea-beaches.
During the glacial period of Europe, the rainfall in Egypt was
probably greater<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">[365]</span>
than at present, and during this period the great wadis received
almost their final sculpturing. After the change from this rainy
climate to the dry one of to-day, erosion still went on, though
more slowly, in the hills; but on the plains and along the coast
accumulation of sands took place, partly owing to wind transport,
and partly owing to the insufficiency of the drainage waters to
carry their load as far as the Nile or sea. The abundance of
coral-reefs in the Red Sea is largely conditioned by the lack of
in-flowing streams of silt-laden water; for the coral animal
flourishes only where the water is clear.</p>

<p>I had hoped, in surveying the country, to be able to place the
boundaries of the territories of the different tribes on the field
maps, and with this object in view I ascertained the claims of each
tribe as precisely as possible from representative men of the
different tribes who accompanied me over the ground.<a id=
"FNanchor_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141" class=
"fnanchor">[141]</a> I found that in several places the tribal
claims overlapped, and in consequence I have not inserted the
boundaries on the general maps. But I was able to obtain a clear
and definite idea of the various claims made at the time, and as
this information was obtained on the actual ground, I propose to
set it down here as being a useful basis for consideration if ever
it is necessary to decide upon the question of rival claims.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">[367]</span>On the small
scale map<a id="FNanchor_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142" class=
"fnanchor">[142]</a> which forms <a href="#pl26">Plate XXVI,</a> I
have shown the various claims as accurately as the scale will admit
of, and a reference to it will enable the statements of claim to be
generally followed; but as the disputed portions frequently concern
somewhat small wadis, it will in some cases be better to refer to
the larger scale maps on Plates <a href="#pl15">XV,</a> <a href=
"#pl17">XVII,</a> and <a href="#pl18">XVIII,</a> to follow the
smaller details.</p>

<p>I would remark that there did not appear to be anything in the
nature of a quarrel between the various tribes over the areas of
disputed ownership, these areas being occupied indifferently by
either tribe, or by men of both tribes living amicably together. It
was only when I attempted to lay down on a map the precise boundary
of each tribe that I found certain areas had two or more claimants.
In the country south of the administrative frontier, the wells and
vegetation are sufficiently abundant, in proportion to the
population, for the question of ownership never to be a matter of
heated controversy in ordinary years; and I am told that the
present relationships of the tribes are so friendly that although
each tribe would resent any statement as to ownership of its
traditional grounds by the others, yet as a matter of fact no
objection is raised to camels and sheep of one tribe grazing in the
grounds of another, a give-and-take policy being usual. When I was
at Halaib, Sheikh Batran Ali Tiut (of the Hamedorab) told me they
never had disputes about grazing rights, as there was plenty of
ground for all; but if a dispute should arise, he would no doubt be
able to settle it amicably with his neighbours, by going to the
place and hearing the evidence of the oldest Arabs in the
particular district and letting custom and tradition decide the
point.<a id="FNanchor_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143" class=
"fnanchor">[143]</a></p>

<p><span class="bold">Boundary between the Ashabab and
Meleikab.</span>—This boundary is defined in the Ministerial
<em>Arrêté</em> of June 25, 1902, to run along the Wadi Hodein from
the sea to Gebel Abraq, and thence southward to Gebel Um el Tiur.
The only difficulty in laying down this line on the map is in
deciding which part of the great plateau of Gebel Abraq to take as
the point, and which of the two Gebels Um el Tiur is meant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">[368]</span>With regard to
Gebel Abraq (<em>see</em> the large scale map on <a href=
"#pl15">Plate XV</a>), the Wadi Hodein passes its south portion;
but the context of the <em>Arrêté</em>, defines the wells of Abraq
(Bir el Sunta, Bir Abu Dibesat, Bir Abraq, and Bir Gumbit) to be in
the Meleikab area, and as these lie further north it is obviously
necessary, in the spirit of the <em>Arrêté</em>, to take a point in
the north portion of Gebel Abraq. From an examination of the map on
<a href="#pl15">Plate XV</a> it will be seen that an easy and
rational interpretation would be to regard the triangulation point,
marked by a beacon on the plateau 1,700 metres north-west of Bir
Abraq, as being a point on the boundary; the line from Gebel Um el
Tiur to pass through this point northwards till it outs the Wadi
Abraq, and thence the boundary line would lie along the course of
Wadis Abraq and Naam to Wadi Hodein. This boundary fulfils the
obvious intention of the <em>Arrêté</em>, and at the same time has
the advantage of being easily traceable on the ground.</p>

<p>As to the two Gebels Um el Tiur, I have already mentioned this
difficulty in connexion with the location of the administrative
boundary (<em>see</em> <a href="#Page_74" class="pginternal">p.
74</a>), and have taken the higher of the two mountains of the same
name as being the one intended.</p>

<p>Before leaving the subject of the Meleikab boundaries, it may be
worth while to mention that at the time the <em>Arrêté</em> of 1902
was issued the country had not been surveyed; it was then thought
that Bir Shalatein lay some fifty kilometres further along the
coast southward than the mouth of Wadi Hodein, and the
<em>Arrêté</em> defined the eastern boundary of the Meleikab
territory to be the coast-line from Wadi Hodein to Bir Shalatein.
But as Bir Shalatein is actually <em>in</em> the Wadi Hodein, the
real result is that the Meleikab area ends in a point on the coast,
and does not include any sea-board at all. The matter is not one of
great moment, because the coast-plain for some distance southward
of Wadi Hodein is very barren; but it illustrates the impossibility
of defining boundaries without either going over the actual ground
or having a reliable map.</p>

<p><span class="bold">The Hamedorab Boundary.</span>—The Hamedorab
claim their boundary to run from Bir Meneiga southward along the
watershed of Gebel Gerf, along the east side of the basin of Wadi
Diqdib to just south of Bir Baaneit, thence to the hill called
Kilia Arib, thence to the hill of Eqrun, thence to the pass of Bani
Sana; at Bani Sana the boundary turns south-westward so as to pass
west of Wadis Hamida and Nubitra,<span class="pagenum" id=

of Wadis Mashushenai and Dibir, thence eastward along the south
side of Wadi Di-ib.</p>

<p>The Hamedorab state that much of the country included in the
Egyptian administration as belonging to the Ashabab is really
Hamedorab country; they claim the north limit of their tribal
territory to commence at the mouth of Wadi Khoda on the coast (in
latitude 23° 42′) and to pass north of Wadis Khoda, Shenshef, and
Shut, thence southward passing west of Wadi Beida to Bir
Meneiga.<a id="FNanchor_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144" class=
"fnanchor">[144]</a> This is of course contrary to the Ministerial
<em>Arrêté</em> of 1902, and as Bramly Bey (<em>The Anglo-Egyptian
Sudan</em>, Vol. I, p. 93) mentions that on the other hand the
Ababda tribe assert that <em>their</em> country should rightly
extend south of the administrative boundary, it is probable that
the administrative frontier represents a fair division of the rival
claims.</p>

<p><span class="bold">The Kurbeilab Boundary.</span>—The Kurbeilab
claim their eastern boundary to run as follows: From Bir Meneiga
southward along the watershed of Gebel Gerf to near the Sherefa
pass, thence south-eastward along the north side of Wadi Sherefa el
Sharqi on to the small hill called Tibashoi Tomokolat, thence
east-north-eastward to Gebel Hamra Dom. From Gebel Hamra Dom
south-eastward to the hill of Osnei, thence southward to the hills
of Ti Keferiai, thence to the pass of Bani Sana. From Bani Sana
southward to Gebel Warabeit, thence along the east side of Wadi
Dibir, along the north side of Wadi el Qurat, across Wadi Di-ib,
and then southwards along the east side of Wadi Di-ib.</p>

<p><span class="bold">The Balgab Boundary.</span>—The Balgab
boundary coincides with the main watershed from the parallel of 22°
northwards to Gebel Adar Qaqa, then passes between the drainages of
Wadi Hasium and Wadi Soaorib to the hill called Kulet Tinasal. From
Kulet Tinasal the boundary runs east-south-eastward across Wadi
Soaorib, passing north of Wadi Dishlo; thence it turns south along
the mountains separating the basin of Wadi Soaorib from that of
Wadi Baueiwai, thence it passes south of the heads of Wadi Miatit,
eastwards across Wadi Aqwem, along the north side of Wadi el Qurat,
across Wadi Di-ib, and then southwards along the eastern side of
Wadi Di-ib.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">[370]</span><span class=

to run from the head of Wadi Diqdib, along the mountains forming
the eastern side of the basin of Wadi Diqdib to a point just south
of Bir Baaneit, thence eastward to Gebel Hamra Dom. From Hamra Dom,
west-south-westward to Tibashoi Tomokolat, thence along the north
side of Wadi Sherefa el Sharqi and along the mountains forming the
west side of the basin of Wadi Diqdib up to the head of that
wadi.</p>

<p>The Koatil further claim as their territory the upper portion of
the basin of Wadi Medarai west of longitude 35° 18′.</p>

<p>The Koatil also own the well called Bir Um Rasein, though all
the wadis in its neighbourhood belong to the Kurbeilab.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Overlapping of Claims.</span>—When the
boundaries of the different tribes as specified above are laid down
on the map (<em>see</em> <a href="#pl26">Plate XXVI</a>), it is
found that there are three tracts claimed by more than a single
tribe. These three disputed areas are:—</p>

<p>(1) A tract south and east of Bir Baaneit, claimed both by the
Koatil and by the Hamedorab. The western part of this area is
relatively well wooded. Its eastern portion includes the water
source called Ti Dabai Hamra Dom.<a id="FNanchor_145"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a></p>

<p>(2) A tract extending southward from Gebel Hamra Dom to the Wadi
Qurat, claimed both by the Kurbeilab and by the Hamedorab. This
area includes the Wadis Hamida, Nubitra, and Dibir, and four not
very important water sources, <em>viz.</em>, Galt Osnei, Megwel
Hamida, Bir Nubitra, and Bir Mashushenai.<a id=
"FNanchor_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146" class=
"fnanchor">[146]</a></p>

<p>(3) A narrow tract including the Wadis Qurat and Di-ib, claimed
by all three tribes Balgab, Kurbeilab, and Hamedorab.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Ownership of Water Sources.</span>—With the
exception of the five water sources just mentioned as lying within
the areas claimed by more than one tribe, there are no disputes
about ownership of water supplies. The wells of the different
tribes are partly enumerated in the <em>Arrêté</em> of 1902, but as
the list there given is far from complete and many of the names are
incorrect, I give below a list of the water sources belonging to
the various tribes within the area surveyed. For particulars of the
various water sources reference should be made to Chapter VII
(<a href="#c07">p. 234</a>).</p>

criticisms of this chapter, remarks: “My experience up to date is
that each principal man has a different idea of his own boundaries
and that those ideas differ from day to day. My impression is that
the Bisharin are as yet one big family, and that the grazing is
ample for all so that the boundaries are very vague between the
different tribes. Disputes of course do arise as to the possession
of wadis, but I find that a week after a certain wadi has been
allotted to one of two tribes, both tribes are amicably grazing in
it side by side without payment. The ownership of wells is more
strictly defined.”</p>

classed as belonging to the Hamedorab in a MS. list of wells drawn
up by Bramly Bey. But he has doubtless so classed them before their
true locality was known; as they lie well to the north of the Sudan
administrative boundary (Shenshef is over one hundred kilometres
from the nearest point of that boundary, on the Egyptian side) the
Hamedorab claim can hardly be maintained.</p>

<hr class="decor spaced2 width3">

<p class="sch">NOTES ON THE ROAD FROM HALAIB TO PORT SUDAN.</p>

<hr class="decor spaced2 width4">

<p class="space-above2">On the completion of the survey work at
Halaib in May 1908, I returned to Cairo by marching in to Port
Sudan and thence taking steamer to Suez. The journey from Halaib to
Port Sudan with baggage camels occupied eleven days, travelling on
an average thirty kilometres a day. This rate of travel did not
permit of any surveying being done en route, but I took brief notes
of the road and the wells on it, and as this road does not appear
to be included in those described in the Sudan Handbook, I give
here the notes I made. The distances are estimated from the times
occupied in marching.</p>

<p>I would mention that from Mohamed Ghul onwards to Port Sudan
there are two roads; a lower one near the sea, usually followed by
the Police patrols, and an upper one which goes a little distance
inland. The upper road was the one I followed, as my guides
informed me that while it was only some eight kilometres longer
than the lower one, there was much better water to be found on
it.</p>

<p>In the sketch maps on Plates <a href="#pl27">XXVII</a> and
<a href="#pl28">XXVIII,</a> I have shown the road and the wells on
it as correctly as is possible from my notes, using the Admiralty
Chart No. 2,336 as a basis for the coast-line and the maps 36 I and
46 A, issued by the Sudan Survey Department, for the position of
Port Sudan and some topographical details. As the direction of
march was roughly north-to-south and the total estimated distances
between Halaib and Mohamed Ghul, and between Mohamed Ghul and Port
Sudan, agree pretty well with those scaled from the maps after
laying down the terminal positions correctly, it may be taken that
the latitudes of the wells are fairly correct, while the longitudes
are liable to greater error as being only rough estimations.</p>
